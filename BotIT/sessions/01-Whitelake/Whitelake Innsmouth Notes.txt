Deeply troubled by the cauldron the Church Knights were hauling back to the Chapel of Verity, and needing supplies
for a lengthy journey, Hedeg suggests to the Players that they might stop in the nearby village of Whitelake.

Bandits on the way?  Deserters?

Whitelake 

"There certainly is a strange kind of streak in the Innsmouth folks today—I don’t know how to explain it, but it sort of makes 
you crawl. You’ll notice a little in Sargent if you take his bus. Some of ’em have queer narrow heads with flat noses and 
bulgy, stary eyes that never seem to shut, and their skin ain’t quite right. Rough and scabby, and the sides of their necks 
are all shrivelled or creased up. Get bald, too, very young. The older fellows look the worst—fact is, I don’t believe I’ve 
ever seen a very old chap of that kind. Guess they must die of looking in the glass! Animals hate ’em—they used to have lots of 
horse trouble before autos came in."

"Queer how fish are always thick off Innsmouth Harbour when there ain’t any anywhere else around—but just try to fish there 
yourself and see how the folks chase you off!"

“Yes, there’s a hotel in Innsmouth—called the Gilman House"

"Seems they get a queer crowd there, for this fellow heard voices in other rooms—though most of ’em was empty—that gave him the 
shivers. It was foreign talk, he thought, but he said the bad thing about it was the kind of voice that sometimes spoke. It 
sounded so unnatural—slopping-like, he said"

Strange jewelry? Made out of something like gold, but not? With strange carving - some geometric, and others clearly
maritine.  These should be chokers and headpieces. Things that interact with the face.

Ice caves under the harbour

A large hole in the iced-over lake, where the white waters lap hungrily, as if trying to escape

Hedeg is there, looking for someone he knew?

The Characters will end up burning this place to the ground

Part of the town is built over the water.
