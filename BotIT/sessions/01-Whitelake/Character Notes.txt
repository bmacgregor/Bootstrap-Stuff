things players want

Mike
	more civil war
	- Put the Bastard on the Throne
	- Life with the beautiful
	- Steal from the unworthy
	- Avenge my fallen brothers in arms
	
Crom
	more combat, specifially against the Gray Church
	- destroy the Gray Church
	- sow strife amongst the Fornish nobility
	
Abi
	nothing
	- make Alistra my queen
	- probably something about the church

Amanda
	same level of rp/interaction : boudicca arc
	- free Kevanja
	- a covenant with the gods
	
Kerrin
	nothing : avicenna?
	- clear my name
	- revenge against Baelin Drannis
	- Find my lost sister
	- reknowned as the greatest healer in the land
	
Next session will likely involve travel to somewhere, be it Whitelake (the nearest settlement) or to Merris (the capital)

If whitelake:
	Steal from the unworthy (MIKE)
	Covenant with the Gods (AMANDA)
	Reknowned healer (KERRIN)
	
	Missing something for Abi and Crom (but I am also missing a bunch of their passions)
	
Make this the next session - the Characters need supplies; they're too far out from civilization in the middle of winter
to survive a lengthy journey, and despite the fact that they have their gear back, these are just basic provisions, and 
will not be sufficient to get them to Marris.

We can have a dungeon here!!  Build a five-room, entrance is based off of my fibonacci puzzle

This will hold a key that will allow the PC's to go beneath the lake

Something to do with lost Naivunnan?
