			<p><em>You surge forward, away from the camp, and toward the tree-line and 
			the dubious freedom that it offers.  Your newfound companions run with 
			you, pounding their feet against the packed snow.  Hedeg, the old blind

			are plunging through the frosted undergrowth, and into the forest.  It's

				<small>The Beginning of the Adventures</small></p>
				
				<p>And so ends the one-shot.  There are a lot of items that have been 
				left purposely vague, should your players want to continue, here are 
				a few things that got left out that you <em>might</em> (please read 
				that with heavy italics - you should play your game the way your group
				wants to play, rather than sticking to anything written here) want to 
				include, should you decide to stay in this campaign world:
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Traem's Poisoners: </strong>Fornholm's old, dead King 
					was poisoned, but not by his daughter, Alistra, as many believe.
					Instead, he was killed by Baelin Drannis, head of the Guild of
					Physikers, in exchange for protection from the Gray Church and
					greater lands and levies, provided by Jerlix Fein and the Council
					of Lords.</li><br/>
					
					<li><strong>The Murder of Artorin: </strong>having gotten the King
					out of the way, Fein needed to act quickly in order to create a 
					power vacuum for himself.  By having Artorin killed and silencing
					his Dukes, as well as casting suspicion on Alistra, he was able to
					have himself named as Regent.</li><br/>
					
					<li><strong>The Queen's Own: </strong>those staunch in their 
					belief in Alistra's innocence count themselves among the Queen's 
					Own.  Although she has yet to be named Queen, her followers 
					demand that the office be granted to her immediately, and have 
					fought several skirmishes against the Lord's Guard.  Their 
					power-base tends to be set among the peasantry, though some 
					nobles feel their lot might be better cast with Alistra, rather
					than the Lords.</li><br/>
					
					<li><strong>Ranulf's War: </strong>although many see the civil war
					as the only item of import going on in Fornholm, this is certainly
					not the case.  Despite being suggested by the Council of Lord's 
					that 'Ranulf's War' in Eldran is a waste of resources, in fact, 
					it's a desperate holding action, which, without proper support is
					doomed to fail, and will herald the Eldrin Empire's full might
					falling on the unprepared Fornholm.</li><br/>
					
					<li><strong>The Iron Cauldron: </strong>a relic better left to 
					the damned, the Iron Cauldron is a powerful artifact, capable of
					creating soulless warriors in exchange for the lives of the 
					innocent.  Steeped in the darkest necromancies of Lost Naivunnan,
					the Cauldron is a great evil, compounded by the fact that it is
					held by Mother Sarevin Caesless and her Gray Church.  As with all
					things though, using the Cauldron has a cost.</li><br/>
					
					<li><strong>Lost Naivunnan: </strong>a kingdom devoured by magic 
					and evil, the Gray Church have unearthed several of Naivunnan's
					artifacts, and intend to use them to their advantage in the war
					for Fornholm.  What they don't realize is that by using these 
					tainted relics, they call Naivunnan back to the world, and awaken 
					the dark that it vanished into a thousand years ago.</li><br/>
