			<p><em>You find the baggage-train at the rear of the convoy - a large 
			wagon, not unlike the one you and your new companions recently escaped, 
			though probably better kept.  A pack of hound's lounge around it, 
			apparently not bothered by the snows.  From your vantage point, it looks 
			like there are five of the beasts.  Four of them are unremarkable; the 
			average war-dog one might expect to be set on peasants, each well muscled 
			and vicious, but the fifth is massive.  A great, shaggy beast that towers 
			over the rest, though now rests by one of the wagon's wheels.</em></p>

				<p>It's up to the players on how to proceed.  If they have the 
				Valerian (or what they <em>think</em> is the Valerian), now would be 
				the time to mix it with the raw meat stolen from the hound master's 
				saddlebags and throw it - hopefully from somewhere out of view - to
				the dogs.</p>
				
				<p>If a player comes within view, so long as they're holding food,
				the dogs won't immediately attack - low growls will be heard, and the
				large hound will turn its massive head to look at the player.  Feeding
				the dogs this way is <em>extremely</em> ill-advised.  Have the player 
				roll an <em>Animal Ken</em> check, needing two (2) successes.  If
				they succeed, the animals remain wary, but hesitate.  If the player
				fails, the hounds begin barking.  The fuss will call the hound-master
				over, who will arrive at some inconvenient time for the players.  If 
				he spots them before the players have dealt with the dogs, he will 
				shout an alarm and order the hounds to attack.  Finally, if the player
				botches this roll, the dogs raise all kinds of hell, baying and 
				snarling, and rise up to attack the offending player, all thoughts of 
				food cast aside.</p>
				
				<p>Similarly, if the players do <em>not</em> come with food (looking 
				for the baggage train with the intent to fight their way to their
				gear), the hounds will respond accordingly.  Again, the hound-master
				will arrive in due course and call guards down on the players.  In all
				likelihood - under geared and overwhelmed - the players will probably
				die.  Do your best to avoid having this happen by playing up the 
				danger of the situation - a successful one-shot should be fun, and 
				invite your players <em>back</em> to the table to try out an actual
				campaign.  That said, if you're playing with people who have gotten
				themselves into this situation, maybe killing them is the right 
				answer?</p>
				
				<p>Finally, if the players are able to get the food to the hounds 
				(either by feeding them directly, or by throwing the meat to them), 
				the encounter plays out depending on the success of their survivalist.
				If the players successfully found the Valerian, the hounds fall into a
				deep sleep relatively quickly.  The large hound succumbs too, 
				eventually, but takes longer than the rest of his pack.  Should the 
				player's feed the hounds the Devil's Ire, however, the result is 
				slightly different.  Instead of falling into peaceful slumber, they 
				go completely mad, baying loudly and causing hell.  As the poison 
				begins to work through their systems, they will run through the camp,
				knocking over anything in their path, and unable to distinguish friend
				from foe.</p>
				
				<p>Should this happen, all pretense of stealth will be utterly 
				destroyed, however, it might be of benefit to the players, since the 
				ensuing chaos will provide a perfect distraction for them to retrieve
				their gear from the baggage-train.

		<p class="h4">Approaching the Wagon</p>
		
		<p><em>Having dealt with the hounds, you approach the wagon, ready to takes
		back what the Church Knights had stolen from you.  Rounding the back, you 
		nearly run into a cauldron large enough for a person to stand in.  Embossed
		figures dance and writhe along its dull iron casing, and ancient letters
		crawl like serpents around the mouth of the great crucible.</p>
		
		<p>A moment later, Hedeg shuffles into view, his hair swirling in the winter
		winds.</em>  'Gods,' <em>he whispers, holding a hand out to steady himself
		on the back of the wagon, </em>'it's worse than I thought.'<em>  The
		old man is facing the cauldron, and his voice, though low, is filled with
		loathing; his sightless eyes narrowed in utter revulsion.</em></p>
		
		<p>'Quickly then,' <em> he says after a moment, </em>'mustn't stay too close 
		to this blasted thing,' <em> and he moves off, letting the rest of you past 
		to claim your missing gear.</em></p>

				<p class="h4">The Iron Cauldron</p>
				
				<p>Players will now, no doubt, be curious about the Iron Cauldron,
				and its ancient letters.  A particularly enterprising character 
				might be tempted to read the script that appears on the relic, 
				despite Hedeg's clear abhorrence for the artifact.  If an attempt
				is made, have the player roll for <em>Decipher</em>.  
				Anything less than three (3) successes reveals nothing other than the
				script is clearly archaic, but nothing more.<p/>
				
				<p>Rolling higher than this tells the player that the language could 
				be Naivunnan, a corrupted civilization, long lost to this world.  
				Naivunnan texts are largely unknown, and other than a scrap of 
				history, they can't tell much more beyond this.  In either case,
				studying the script is difficult, as it wavers sickeningly within
				the viewer's sight, and Hedeg will most likely scold the curious 
				player, saying that wiser minds than the players know when to leave
				well enough alone.</p>
				
				<p>Touching the chill metal will leech heat from a player - indeed, it
				seems that the winter is far harsher near the cauldron, its bitter
				vileness bleeding into the marrow of any who try to stand close for 
				too long.  Climbing inside would be akin to dropping oneself into a
				bath of nitrogen, that is to say, deadly.</p>
