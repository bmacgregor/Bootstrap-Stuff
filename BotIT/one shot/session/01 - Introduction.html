				<p class="h4">Some Questions</p>
					
				<p>It’s too dark to clearly see everyone, but start thinking about 
				what you look like.  If you’re a warrior, are your hands calloused?  
				Has your skin been weathered by the sun?  Are you part of the Queen's 
				Own, a mercenary, a wanderer?  If you’re a mage, similar questions 
				apply – do you smell of acrid herbs and smoke?  Are you a 
				hedge-wizard?  A sorcerer’s apprentice who has run off, perhaps?  A 
				caution, however, should you choose this path - sorcery is 
				<em>highly</em> illegal in Fornholm, the country you're currently in,
				and as such, perhaps your arcane skills might better be kept hidden
				for the moment.</p>
				
				<p>This is the kind of game where <em>who you are</em> matters – in 
				fact, that’s largely what drives the story.  Your old grudges, dreams, and passions are the things that <em>Blade</em> is 
				centered around, so when you choose something for your character, 
				don’t do so lightly.</p>
				
				<p>What you know right now is this: you are in the country of 
				Fornholm, which is in the midst of a bloody civil war, of which there 
				are several different sides.  The old king is dead, and his eldest 
				son was probably murdered by his loyal Dukes; his death made to look 
				like a hunting accident.  The remaining heir to the throne is 
				suspected of poisoning her father, or at least being incompetent 
				enough to send his healers and physikers away when he needed them 
				most, though many suspect that it was the healers themselves that 
				killed the king, and the princess didn't catch on until much too 
				late.</p>
				
				<p>Her half-brother - an illegitimate bastard who was given a 
				military post and swept under the rug - is away, campaigning in 
				distant lands.  He probably hasn't heard of his father's death yet, 
				or of the accusations of murder and treason that surely follow.  
				Several other factions have sprouted up; namely that of the Council 
				of Lords and those that fight under the banner of the True Queen, 
				though new names are thrown into the ring almost daily to claim 
				control of the rudderless country.</p>
				
				<p>Of these factions, you've been taken by the Gray Church and its 
				Witchfinders, a fanatical group led by the mad and powerful Mother 
				Sarevin Caesless, head of the Church, and keen to add to her sphere 
				of influence.  The Gray Church is yet another faction locked in the 
				struggle for Fornholm and the glittering jewel in her centre, the 
				Ivory City of Marris, and among other things, it's known for the 
				fervent hunt for those suspected of having the ungodly taint of 
				magic in their veins.</p>
				
				<p>What the zealous followers of the Church do with those unlucky 
				enough to be caught is widely speculated, but escapes from the Chapel 
				of Verity - the Church's seat of power - are all but unknown.</p>

		<p><em>A bent figure near the door turns to regard each of you.  From the
		moonlight streaming through the bars, you can almost see his face through the 
		murk.  He is an old man, bowed by great age, but his gaze is heavy, as if by 
		simply looking he might drag your secrets screaming into the wagon to swirl 
		amidst the frozen air like unwelcome ghosts.</p>
		
		<p>You shudder, and his lips part in a rictus of a smile that lists insanely 
		off to one side.  He coughs wetly, and after a moment you realize that the 
		old man is laughing into the night as he throws his head back like a wild 
		animal, and shakes so hard that you're sure he'll fall into a seizure, or 
		some kind of mad fit.</em></p>
		
		<p>'Well met,'<em> he crows.</em>  'Well met indeed, though it seems rather 
		bleak at the moment.'<em>  He pauses and cants his head to one side, as if 
		trying to remember something important.</em>  'I am called Hedeg,'<em> he 
		says.</em>  'Hedeg of Embarl, and I have been looking forward to meeting you 
		all for some time.'</p>

				<p class="h4">A Narrative Beat</p>
				
				<p>By now, the players will more than likely want to do things (jumpy 
				lot that players tend to be).  Too much narration tends to make their 
				eyes glaze over, and slows down the action.  So!  Let them flex their 
				RP muscles - now is, after all, the time for talk.  Stress that - 
				unless they have very keen eyesight - the interior of the wagon is 
				almost pitch black.  What's more, it's cold.  This might not bother 
				someone from the Winter Wastes, but any city-folk in the group will 
				be decidedly uncomfortable in the chilly, cramped quarters.</p>
				
				<p>They've been stripped of their gear, so bashing their way out of 
				the wagon isn't likely.  Should they try such an approach, be sure to 
				mention that the wagon hasn't stopped moving yet, and that if by some 
				chance the driver doesn't notice (all call a few guards over), then 
				surely one of the accompanying horsemen <em>will</em>.  Hedeg will 
				watch escape attempts bemusedly, but isn't likely to participate - 
				the old seer knows more than he lets on.</p>
				
				<p>If they decide to talk to Hedeg, he will reveal a few things:
				<ul>
					<li>He knows how to get out of the wagon, but isn't interested in 
					wandering around outside, alone in the cold, and won't risk his 
					knees leaping to the road while the damned thing is moving</li>
					
					<li>He saw each of the players be captured by the Church Knights.
					Luckily, their captor's <em>do not</em> include any Witchfinders 
					- he spits after saying the name - but he thinks it's only a 
					matter of time before they meet up with a larger contingent of 
					<em>'crazy, raving lunatics'</em></li>
					
					<li>He has a good idea of where everyone's equipment is being 
					kept, but unless the player's help him escape, he'll never tell 
					them how to slip past the hounds that patrol the camp when a halt 
					is called for the night</li>
				</ul>
					
				Under no circumstances will Hedeg reveal any sort of magical ability 
				(at least, he won't come out any say anything about it).  Instead, 
				he'll grin a gap-toothed smile, and laugh heartily; he's not one to 
				tip his hand so early, and although he has plans for the players, he 
				need to make sure they'll play the parts he has in mind for them.</p>
					
				<p>Once the players agree to help Hedeg to safety - or at least as 
				far as the forests' tree-line, read the next part:</p>

		<p><em>The old man grins, </em>"A bargain then!"<em> he exclaims, his blind 
		eyes crinkling at their edges.  His hands slap together, and he capers around 
		the small cell in a bizarre dance.  He chortles crazily and the rhythm of 
		his claps fall into a strange cadence that echoes throughout the cramped 
		interior of the wagon.  The sound amplifies, twisting in the air as it 
		spirals out, into the night.  In moments, it's all around you, a steady 
		crashing, like a great bellows, or a smith working a piece of metal, and as 
		it tears at your ears, you can hear Hedeg's gleeful, wailing laughter.</p>
		
		<p>In the distance, horses scream as something enormous falls to the earth - 
		the force of its crash causing the wagon to nearly tip onto its side.  Only 
		the driver's quick reflexes and mastery over his animals keep it upright.  
		Hedeg stops his dance and looks around the room, triumphantly.</p>
		
		<p></em>'Now then',<em> he says, </em> reaching a gnarled hand into his wispy,
		uneven hair, </em> 'which one of you is good with locks?'  <em>And he tugs 
		free a small pick and tension wrench hidden in his bedraggled mop, holding 
		the tools blindly out to any of you that might take them.</em></p>

				<p class="h4">Picking the Lock</p>
				
				<p>Picking the wagon's lock would normally be a task of easy 
				difficulty, however, because it must be done by reaching 
				<em>through</em> the grill of the door, and the player doing the 
				picking doesn't want to be noticed, it instead requires two (2) 
				successes.</p>
				
				<p><u>Note</u>: This check is here mostly to get someone rolling dice.
				Picking the lock has to happen so that the players can escape the 
				wagon, and isn't intended to act as a barrier to the players - in 
				other words, even though it's a check they roll for, they can't 
				really fail this one.  It's here mainly for cinematic effect, and 
				also because the door needs to 'feel like' it's locked.  This check 
				will also take care of the shackles around each prisoner's wrists, 
				though it seems that Hedeg either was left unbound, or had slipped 
				free earlier.</p>
