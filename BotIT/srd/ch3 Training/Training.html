			<p class="h2">Character Progression</p>
			<p>As your character experiences new things, furthers his own goals, beliefs, and personal philosophies, he 
			will also improve in many ways. There is no concept of character “levels”, as each trait grows independently, 
			allowing the entire character to grow and change according to his player’s wishes. All advancement comes from 
			one source: constant effort in playing out and furthering one’s Passion Attributes. Each major aspect of your 
			character, and how to advance in that area, is now discussed.</p>

			<p class="h4">Raising Basic Attributes</p>
			<p>Any Attribute may be raised by spending Passion Attribute equal to three times its current score. Raising a 
			character’s “Focus” Attribute costs 1 point less. No Attribute may be increased by more than one point per 
			session.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_Proficiencies">Buying and Raising Proficiencies</p>
			<p>These are easier to raise than Attributes, but require that a character either spend some time training or 
			use the Proficiency in the course of play. Not much training is needed, assuming the character has an hour or 
			so a day to spend practicing. </p>
			
			<p>To raise Proficiency by one level, simply spend a number of Passion Attribute points equal to twice the 
			current Proficiency level. Hence the cost to raise the Greatsword Proficiency from 4 to 5 would be 8 Passion 
			Attribute Points. As with Attributes only one level increase per Proficiency is allowed during any one game 
			session.</p>
			
			<p>Acquiring a new Proficiency requires either that the Proficiency has been used during the course of play, 
			or that a teacher with Proficiency level 3 or better was consulted. These cost a mere 1 Passion point. 
			Entirely new Proficiencies are bought up from the PC’s best default rating in that Proficiency. Thus buying 
			Cut & Thrust would cost 1 point to begin at level 1, but if already proficient in Greatsword (which defaults 
			to Cut & Thrust at -3) you could buy the new Proficiency as if you were already at the same level as 
			Greatsword -3.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_Assets">Buying and Raising Assets</p>
			<p>Some Assets may be bought or bought off during the game, provided that these developments seem plausible to 
			the group. Acquiring an entirely new Good Asset or buying off a Poor Asset acquired from the Culture Priority 
			Pick costs 20 Passion. Buying off a Poor Asset not derived from the Culture Priority choice, or acquiring the 
			Good aspect of an Asset of which the character already has the Poor aspect costs only 15 Passion.</p>
			
			<p>With some Assets, for example Berserk and Spell-Gifted, it does not make sense to have both their Good and 
			Poor aspects simultaneously. If a character has the Poor aspect of one and buys it off, he can never acquire 
			its Good aspect. If he has designs of changing such an Asset’s Poor aspect into the Good one, he first must 
			purchase the Good aspect and only then buy off the Poor aspect. For as long as he has not bought off the Poor 
			aspect, it applies in full and he does not receive the benefits from the purchased Good aspect.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_Skills">Buying and Raising Skills</p>
			<p>Skills are easy to develop. To raise a Skill by one level, simply spend a number of Passion Attribute 
			points equal to the current Skill level. Entirely new Skills may be purchased for 1 Passion Attribute point, 
			and begin at level 1. Keep in mind that when purchasing a new Skill at a level lower than the rating the 
			PC has in that Skill’s most applicable Attribute (as listed in the Skill’s description), it will cost 1 point 
			less than the Attribute’s rating, though always at least 1 point.</p>
			
			<p>Finally, improving one’s Skill rating in either the Ancient Languages or Foreign Language Skill costs one 
			less Passion point than would otherwise be charged, though again a minimum of 1 point must be spent. 
			Furthermore, the initial Passion point expended towards the acquisition of an entirely new Foreign Language 
			(though not Ancient Language) Skill immediately buys an initial rating level of 2, not 1.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_Loot">Loot</p>
			<p>The Loot rating measures a character’s wealth. Every point in it represents an abstract amount of 
			affluence. In more concrete terms, every point of Loot represents roughly ten times the wealth of the level 
			immediately below it. This encompasses a character’s total wealth in both money and movable and immovable 
			goods.</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>0 : Dead broke. Just the shabby or torn (and thus worthless) clothes on your back</li>
				<li>1 : Poor. A set of clothes, some coin, or a few items</li>
				<li>2 : Average. The normal amount of wealth for a commoner</li>
				<li>3 : Rich. Fashionable clothes and spending money</li>
				<li>4 : Filthy Rich. Accompianied by servants</li>
				<li>5 : Fantastically Rich. Titled nobility</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>If a character wants to buy something, the referee judges whether his Loot score suggests that he should be 
			able to afford it or not. If the purchase seems clearly within the character’s means, he can buy it. If it’s 
			judged to be well beyond it, he can’t.</p>
			
			<p>If the issue seems questionable, the character’s Cunning pool is typically rolled against either a 
			Challenging or Difficult task. If the Check is successful, the character can make the purchase, but he can’t 
			afford to make any other purchase that would require a roll for the remainder of the session.</p>
			
			<p>A newly created character’s Loot is set at any level the player wants, provided it corresponds to the PC’s 
			backstory and the circumstances under which he commences play. The entire group is the communal arbitrator of 
			whether an assigned Loot score is reasonable or not.</p>
			
			<p>When a character acquires money or valuables of a magnitude that suggests an increase to his current Loot, 
			his rating is increased automatically, provided the wealth gained is judged to be clearly many times greater 
			than the character’s current means. If it is merely deemed to be considerably greater, the character should 
			make a Cunning Check with his possible new Loot rating as the Challenge Level. If he passes the test, his Loot 
			rating increases.</p>
			
			<p>Sword & Sorcery protagonists are notoriously bad at hanging on to money, either because they spend 
			fistfuls of it on drink, wenching, gambling and other forms of hard carousing, or because they simply don’t 
			seem to care much about keeping their accounts balanced. Therefore, a character’s Loot rating is decreased by 
			1 between game sessions, provided that considerable game time has passed since the last session.</p>
			
			<p>The player can avoid having his Loot deteriorate if he passes a Check of his character’s CG with a 
			Challenge Level of (5 – current Loot). PAs don’t apply to this roll, but Drama can be spent in the usual 
			manner. What constitutes a sufficient span of time for Loot to decrease due to spending depends on the 
			circumstances in which this time is passed. In a city, a week is definitely sufficient, but in a remote 
			monastery or some such, several months should pass before a roll becomes necessary.</p>
