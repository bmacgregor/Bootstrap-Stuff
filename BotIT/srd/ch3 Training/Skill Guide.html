			<p class="h2">A Guide to Choosing Skills</p>
			<p>Unlike other systems, the skill list in <em>Blade</em> should not be seen as a shopping-list. Essentially,
			Characters should only have skills that are <em>central to who they are</em>. Think of your Character as they
			might appear in a work of fiction. If the imaginary audience wouldn't <strong>immediately</strong> connect
			your character with a certain pursuit, then this skill should not be purchased, even if the Character is
			considered to have some knowledge of it. For instance, Indiana Jones probably has some knowledge of first-aid,
			but he's not known for being a combat medic, or wandering doctor. He probably doesn't have <em>Healing</em> as a 
			skill.</p>

			<p class="h4">An Example of Skill-Use</p>
			<p>If your Character has an attribute of four (4) or higher, learning a skill at level one 
			should <em>not</em> be done. That said, a rating of two or higher in a skill is a different case.</p>
			
			<p>Suppose you need to make an average (one success) Skill Check. Being a Player Character, you most likely 
			have Passion dice to add in to your roll; for the sake of example, let’s assume you have two. If you have 
			an Attribute of four, you would roll six dice (four for your Attribute, plus two for your Passion), and you 
			would need two successes (that is, normally a single success is required, but since you're rolling this checked
			using your Attribute, the required number of successes is doubled).</p>
			
			<p>If you have a skill at level two, you would roll four dice (two for your skill, and another two for your 
			Passion), but you would only need a single success. Using your skills offer a better chance of success.</p>
		
			<p class="h4">What's the Difference?</p>
			<p>Here, the difference is no big deal, as even the worse odds are still heavily in the Character’s favour. 
			However, this matters more with harder Checks. In the same example, if two successes would have been needed,
			the Skill Check would involve rolling four dice for two successes, while the Attribute Check would use six dice 
			for <em>four</em> successes...</p>
			
			<p>As Characters will almost always have Passion dice to add to their Checks, having a Skill a rating X will 
			<em>almost always</em> offer better chances of successes than having an Attribute at a rating of 2X + 1.</p>
			
			<p class="h4">Going Skill-Heavy</p>
			<p>Going Skill-heavy isn't a bad thing at all, <strong>provided that you don't purchase any Skill at ratings 
			below four</strong>. Only things that are central to the character concept and define the character should 
			be purchased as Skills.</p>
			
			<p>Placing an emphasis on your Character's skills makes them very effective in a number of limited pursuits — 
			provided you don’t squander your 33 or 48 points by purchasing a dozen Skills, all at level three. The way to 
			do it is to put 4+, or better yet 6+ into a limited num­ber of Skills, again, into those (and only those) 
			pursuits that define the character, the way a character in fiction is defined.</p>
			
			<p>While this is apparent from looking at the mechanics, it indeed doesn’t say so explicitly anywhere in the 
			rules. If your character is neither a keen mountaineer, nor a cat­burglar, Climbing probably isn’t purchased; 
			similarly, if your character isn’t a a courtier, diplomat, or politician, Etiquette isn’t taken. If you 
			don't envision your character as a warrior, fighting predominantly from horseback or making a living from 
			riding, or a member of a Mongol-​like horseman culture, Riding isn’t purchased.</p>
