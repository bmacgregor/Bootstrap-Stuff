			<p class="h2">Asset Overview</p>
			<p>If a player creates a character with one or more of the Assets described here, he has three basic choices 
			as to how the character views each Asset. Firstly, the character might view the Asset as a weakness. One with 
			this view might try to hide the Asset or make excuses for his behavior. On the other hand, he might seek out 
			others with the same Asset so as to feel better about his own idiosyncrasy. </p>
		</div>
	</div>
	<!-- Jumbotron ends here -->
	
	<!-- Content begins here -->
	<div class="container text-justify">
		<div>
			<p class="h4">Asset Description</p>
			<p>The character might view the Asset as a strength, and thus may call attention to it; encourage others to 
			act in ways that mimic it; or simply assume that those without the Asset are less worthy than those who 
			possess it.</p>
			
			<p>Finally, the character might not acknowledge the Asset at all. A character might adopt this attitude for 
			several reasons, each suggesting something different about his background and personality: The character might 
			not be aware of the Asset. For example, someone nearsighted might not realize that others see better; his 
			impairment is mild and its progression so gradual that he never notices the change.</p>
			
			<p>The character might be aware of the Asset but reluctant to admit that he possesses it. For example, an 
			abrasive character might realize that his crass mannerisms affect others, yet he finds solace in putting the 
			blame on those whom he offends rather than on himself.</p>
			
			<p>Lastly, the character might know, but simply not care, about his Asset.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_Abrasive">Abrasive</p>
			<p><em>You are difficult and demanding in conversation. This tends to oppress those around you.</em></p>
			<p><strong>Good</strong>: You gain a -2 TN modifier on all Checks involving intimidation.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Poor</strong>: You take a +2 TN modifier on Checks involving endearing oneself to others, or 
			Negotiation.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Role-playing Ideas</strong>: Characters with this Asset might be loud and abrupt or quiet and 
			sinister, but either way, most find them disconcerting or irritating.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_AbsentMinded">Absent Minded</p>
			<p><em>You are fascinated by knowledge and learning, and are capable of pursuing complex trains of thought 
			quite quickly. However, your preoccupation with such thoughts makes you less aware of your surroundings.</em></p>
			<p><strong>Good</strong>: You gain a -2 TN modifier on Checks involving knowledge or learning.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Poor</strong>: You take a +2 TN modifier on Checks involving awareness of one’s surroundings.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Role-playing Ideas</strong>: Characters with this Asset might flit from idea to idea, trailing off 
			in mid-sentence or mumbling their way through complex ideas. Conversely, characters with this Asset might be 
			extremely articulate, but still allow their thoughts to move faster than the pace of a conversation.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_Addiction">Addiction</p>
			<p><em>The character is addicted to a drug that has at least two out of the following three properties: highly 
			illegal, very expensive, and/or debilitating.</em></p>
			
			<p><strong>Good</strong>: There are no good aspects to the Addiction Asset.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Poor</strong>: An addict can go without a fix for a full day, but his TNs increase as his withdrawal 
			pangs rise by a daily cumulative +1. (This does not apply to rolls in highly stressful situations when the rush 
			of adrenaline drowns out the withdrawal symptoms for a short time.) The daily penalty also equals the number 
			of successes the character must achieve on a Tenacity Check in order to turn down an offer of the drug when 
			the player wants to stay free of its scourge.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Role-playing Ideas</strong>: A drug is regarded as debilitating when a character under its influence 
			is completely unable to act at all, or when it reduces his chances of success to one third or less of what 
			they would be when he is in a sober state (i.e. three times the number of successes necessary).</p>
			
			<p>Player and ref should cooperate to come up with a drug from the setting that fits the bill.</p>
			
			<p><em>This Asset is appropriate for Decadents.</em></p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_Aggressive">Aggressive</p>
			<p><em>You are quick to initiate combat, and you tend to press the attack once battle is joined. Your 
			enthusiasm makes you a dangerous foe, but you sometimes leave yourself open to blows that a more cautious 
			warrior would avoid.</em></p>
			
			<p><strong>Good</strong>: You gain a –1 Attack Target Number modifier to all offensive Maneuvers made during 
			combat, until you execute your first Defensive Maneuver.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Poor</strong>: You gain a +1 DTN penalty to all Defensive Maneuvers made during a combat, until 
			you successfully execute an Offensive Maneuver.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Role-playing Ideas</strong>: Characters with this Asset are often hotheaded and quick to anger, or 
			they simply think that the best defense is a quick offense.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_Ambidextrous">Ambidextrous</p>
			<p><em>The character is equally agile and dexterous with his left and right hands.</em></p>
			
			<p><strong>Good</strong>: The character does not suffer the usual +1 TN for weapons wielded in the off hand. 
			He has –1 TN for certain rare activities that require dexterity in both hands at the same time, for example 
			juggling.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Poor</strong>: There is no poor aspect to the Ambidextrous Asset.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Role-playing Ideas</strong>: Ambidextrous characters might enjoy startling others with surprising 
			displays of dexterity in what is commonly considered their offhand.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_Arrogance">Arrogance</p>
			<p><em>The character is arrogant to a point that it is very hard for him to give pride of place to any lesser 
			man, let alone follow his orders. It is very galling for him to be treated without the immense respect he 
			believes to be his due.</em></p>
			
			<p><strong>Good</strong>: The character makes all Checks to resist bullying, intimidation, being cowed or 
			ordered around, and the like against TN –2.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Poor</strong>: The character must succeed at a TY Check to stomach even the smallest or imagined 
			slight. The difficulty of this Check depends on the severity of the incident, but it could easily rate 
			Difficult or Amazing. A failure implies the character cannot stand the treatment, and he must take immediate 
			action. His condescension towards those he considers his inferiors requires him to take a +1 TN modifier for 
			social interaction.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Role-playing Ideas</strong>: The character might be quietly confident, or exude an aura of 
			nobility, or be unbearably haughty. His choice of dress and gear might reflect his outlook.</p>
			
			<p><em>This Asset is appropriate for Decadents.</em></p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_Berserk">Berserk</p>
			<p><em>The character is known to engage in fits of berserk rage, during which he strikes out violently at all 
			who oppose him, with no regard for his own safety.</em></p>
			
			<p><strong>Good</strong>: The character will never slip into a berserk rage by chance, but only by choice. 
			While somebody with the Poor aspect of this Asset would be compelled to Check, the character with the Good 
			aspect must concentrate for one Combat Round and succeed at a Challenging DG Check.</p>
			
			<p>If he does not achieve the necessary 2 Successes on a single roll, he may opt to continue concentrating and 
			turn the task into Timed Check, with another Check allowed every Round. When the player wants his character to 
			emerge from the berserk rage he must accumulate 5 Successes on a Timed HT Check, rolled each Combat Round. 
			Until he achieves the Successes, he must go on savaging everyone, including friends or allies.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Poor</strong>: The character has little or no control over his berserk fits and can’t enter them 
			voluntarily. Whenever he is struck in combat, he must Check HT and achieve more Successes than the inflicted 
			Wound Level. A failure means he will fall into a berserk rage. The same Check is required when the character 
			is grievously mistreated or when he discovers somebody for whom he has a positive PA has been injured (Wound 
			Level 1+). The number of Successes required must be one greater than the PA’s current score.</p>
			
			<p>The player cannot choose to forego these Checks and fail deliberately. To snap out of the berserk rage a 
			Legendary Timed HT Check is required, beginning the Combat Round after the last enemy in sight is defeated. 
			The character must continue his savage attacks on anyone who looks alive, including friends, until 5 Successes 
			are accumulated.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Role-playing Ideas</strong>: While berserk, a character cannot make any defensive Maneuver that 
			does not have an offensive component to it. This limits him to Block Open & Strike, Duck & Weave, Evasive 
			Attack, Master-Strike, Overrun, Simultaneous Block/Strike and Winding & Binding. Also he may not execute 
			offensive Maneuvers whose goal is not direct injury to his opponent. This rules out Beat, Disarm, Hook, Stop 
			Short and Toss.</p>
			
			<p>While berserk, the character’s frame of mind is such that he suffers only ½ Shock and ⅓ Pain from any wound 
			he suffers. (Be sure to record the unreduced values, as these will return full force once the berserk rage 
			wears off).</p>
			
			<p>Any opponent will be greatly unsettled in the face of a berserk fighter who has no regard for his own 
			safety. An opponent must pay double the normal activation cost for all offensive Maneuvers he aims at the 
			berserk fighter. (Activation cost 0 becomes 1).</p>
			
			<p><em>This Asset is appropriate for Degenerates.</em></p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_Brawler">Brawler</p>
			<p><em>Your instincts dictate that you fight close to your opponent, grabbing and punching, rather than 
			striking with a weapon.</em></p>
			
			<p><strong>Good</strong>: You gain a -1 TN modifier on unarmed attack and Grapple Checks.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Poor</strong>: You take a +1 TN modifier for all your attacks at medium or further range.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Role-playing Ideas</strong>: Characters with this Asset often spurn weapons entirely. Some learn 
			refined martial arts to complement their instinctive fighting techniques. Many brawlers may not have a 
			conscious awareness of fighting differently from other characters; they simply know that the best way to 
			take someone out of a fight is to grab him or punch him in the face.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_Cannibalism">Cannibalism</p>
			<p><em>The character has a craving for human flesh.</em></p>
			
			<p><strong>Good</strong>: There is no good aspect to the Cannibalism Asset.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Poor</strong>: Those who do not share this taste will be shocked and will shun any character 
			discovered to be a cannibal. Any Check for friendly social interaction by a known man-eater has a raised TN 
			between +1 (for impersonal ones, like haggling) and +3 (for overtly intimate ones, like seduction).</p>
			
			<p><strong>Role-playing Ideas</strong>: This affliction pertains largely to role-playing. However, should the 
			character encounter an opportunity to feast on human flesh when it would be impolitic to do so, he must Check 
			Tenacity to resist his appetite. The difficulty of this Check depends on how hard it would be to sate his 
			hunger, on the period of abstinence he has endured, and on the likelihood of another opportunity to feed 
			arising soon.</p>
			
			<p><em>This Asset is appropriate for Degenerates.</em></p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_Cautious">Cautious</p>
			<p><em>You are cautious in combat, even a bit cowardly, and you take more care than others to defend yourself. 
			However, this caution renders you susceptible to fear.</em></p>
			
			<p><strong>Good</strong>: You gain a –1 TN modifier when Partially Evading and a –2 TN modifier when Fully 
			Evading.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Poor</strong>: You take a +2 TN modifier on Checks made to resist and overcome fear, and +1 TN to 
			Surprise Checks, as you tend to freeze in face of sudden danger.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Role-playing Ideas</strong>: Characters with this Asset might consistently urge talking rather than 
			fighting. Alternatively, while not actively discouraging their companions from combat, they might remain as 
			far from foes as possible, using ranged weapons or spells.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_Connection">Connection</p>
			<p><em>The character has either a useful friendly connection or a dangerous enmity to a person or organization 
			in the core area of the campaign.</em></p>
			
			<p><strong>Good</strong>: The character has an individual or organization willing to go to great lengths to 
			aid him, even if this poses a risk to his / its own reputation, affluence, wellbeing and – in some instances - 
			life. If the friendly individual or organization is destroyed, the player must wait for sessions equal to 5 – 
			successes on a HT Check before he is allowed to replace the connection with another one, in consultation with 
			the Ref.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Poor</strong>: The character’s sworn enemy - an individual or organization-is willing to go to 
			considerable lengths to damage and undo him. If this enemy is destroyed and the player passes a HT Check, the 
			Ref must allow a number of sessions equal to the successes on this Check to pass before he replaces the enemy 
			with a new one, in consultation with the player.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Role-playing Ideas</strong>: In a session during which the connection could conceivably appear, 
			the ref rolls for this occurrence. If d12 comes up 7+ or 10+ the appearance is guaranteed as follows: If the 
			TN chosen for the Asset is 7, the ally/opponent shows up with a total strength and resources equal to no more 
			than twice those of a PC’s starting tally. If the TN is 10, the strength and resources will be three or four 
			times the PC’s starting tally. The Connection may take many guises: an individual, a group or a supernatural 
			creature (like a totem spirit).</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_Detached">Detached</p>
			<p><em>You maintain a distance from events. This keeps you grounded, but it limits your reaction speed.</em></p>
			
			<p><strong>Good</strong>: You take a –2 TN modifier on Checks to keep your cool, resist pressure, or remain 
			sane or unimpressed. You choose your place in the Order of Limelights as if your CG were 3 higher than its 
			actual score.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Poor</strong>: You take a +2 TN modifier on Surprise Checks and on Checks to notice things you are 
			not actively looking out for.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Role-playing Ideas</strong>: Characters with this Asset are likely to be quiet and restrained, but 
			they might be vocal when others falter in their beliefs.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_Dishonest">Dishonest</p>
			<p><em>You are naturally deceitful and insincere. You have a talent for lying, but have difficulty 
			convincing others when you do speak truthfully.</em></p>
			
			<p><strong>Good</strong>: You gain a -2 TN modifier on Checks related to bluffing or guile.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Poor</strong>: You take a +2 TN modifier to Negotiation and all Checks related to appearing 
			truthful or gaining trust. People will generally be disinclined to believe you.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Role-playing Ideas</strong>: Characters with this Asset might be portrayed as crafty liars, or 
			lying might simply be second nature to them, making truth-telling a difficult chore.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_Distinctive">Distinctive</p>
			<p><em>You have a distinctive physical feature such as a scar, a prominent nose, a limp, or some similar 
			characteristic that is hard to disguise or conceal.</em></p>
			
			<p><strong>Good</strong>: If the characters you are dealing with have any chance at all to have heard of you, 
			they will recognize you for who you are, provided this is beneficial to you. If it isn’t beneficial, they 
			will only recognize you if the alternative would be ridiculously implausible.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Poor</strong>: If the characters you are dealing with have any chance at all to have heard of you, 
			they will recognize you for who you are, provided this is detrimental to you. To avoid this, you can use the 
			Disguise Skill, which you utilize at +3 TN.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Role-playing Ideas</strong>: Characters with this Asset might be sensitive about it, or they might 
			play up its presence to gather attention, sympathy, or notoriety.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_Dreaded">Dreaded</p>
			<p><em>There is something about you - a physical aspect, aura, or reputation - that suggests you are supremely 
			dangerous or deadly. This palpable menace does not impress and affect animals or supernatural 
			opponents.</em></p>
			
			<p><strong>Good</strong>: In combat, your enemies are only allowed to declare as aggressors in the first 
			Round if they pay an Activation Cost equal to half your DG. Offensive Maneuvers executed against you require 
			1 additional Activation Cost (minimum 1). All your hostile sorceries are resisted at +1 TN by targets who 
			are aware of them. You take a –1 TN modifier to intimidation Checks.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Poor</strong>: In combat, hostiles will always single you out as a primary target for immediate 
			elimination. Take a +2 TN modifier for friendly social interaction with people not closely acquainted with 
			you.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Role-playing Ideas</strong>: It might be the character’s reputation, or something about him, that 
			makes him project dread. He may either play upon this or try to play it down.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_Dwarf">Dwarf</p>
			<p><em>The character is abnormally small – at least 75% of the height of an average person. This may be 
			extreme: s/he may measure up to 60% less than the average of his / her gender.</em></p>
			
			<p><strong>Good</strong>: There is no Good aspect to the Dwarf Asset.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Poor</strong>: The characters Move Attribute is decreased by –1. In addition, all his effective 
			weapon lengths in combat are decreased by one Reach increment, to a minimum of Hand.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Role-playing Ideas</strong>: Characters with this Asset who use the Disguise Skill to pass 
			themselves off as normal sized persons make such Checks at +4 TN.</p>
			
			<p><em>This Asset is appropriate for Degenerates.</em></p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_Easygoing">Easygoing</p>
			<p><em>You are naturally friendly. Others feel comfortable around you; however, this Asset makes it difficult 
			for you to be pushy or suspicious.</em></p>
			
			<p><strong>Good</strong>: You gain a -2 TN modifier on Checks related to making casual acquaintances and 
			gaining their trust, including Checks for Information Gathering. You also Check Seduction at –1 TN.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Poor</strong>: You take a +2 TN modifier to all Checks to intimidate or project authority, and on 
			Checks related to formal social interaction, including most applications of Etiquette.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Role-playing Ideas</strong>: Characters with this Asset might be more easily manipulated in 
			interactions with NPCs, or they might simply prefer not to argue and instead use their natural talent to 
			learn more about the world around them.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_Eunuch">Eunuch</p>
			<p><em>The (male) character has been castrated.</em></p>
			
			<p><strong>Good</strong>: The character has been castrated after the onset of puberty and is not readily 
			recognizable as a eunuch and able to function sexually. Hits to his groin use the wound description and values 
			of hits to a woman’s groin. He resists attempts at seduction with TN –1 and is affected mechanically by a 
			sexually compatible character’s beauty as if sexually incompatible.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Poor</strong>: The character has been castrated before the onset of puberty and is therefore a 
			readily recognizable eunuch. Most other men and quite a few women (ref’s discretion), Decadents excepted, 
			will react poorly to an allegedly “effeminate” eunuch. Thus all TNs for the eunuch’s attempts at friendly 
			social interaction will be raised by +1. This does not apply to the character’s close acquaintances who know 
			him well enough to look beyond prejudice. In addition, if he uses the Disguise Skill to try to pass himself 
			off as an un-castrated man, his TN to do so is increased by +2. He is unable to function sexually.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Role-playing Ideas</strong>: Characters with this Asset need not be overweight, but if they have 
			been castrated before the onset of puberty there is definitely a certain soft plumpness to their features. 
			Their voices lack male depth; they cannot grow beards; and they are unable to father children.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_Farsighted">Farsighted</p>
			<p><em>You have difficulty focusing on nearby objects, but your distance vision is more keen than 
			normal.</em></p>
			
			<p><strong>Good</strong>: You gain a -2 TN modifier on Checks related to spotting or discerning something at 
			mid to far distances. You gain +1 die to your Archery Pool for every Range Band beyond Near (maximum +3).</p>
			
			<p><strong>Poor</strong>: You have a +3 TN modifier on Checks when attempting to discern small details very 
			close to you, for example when searching an area, or scanning an object closely for clues.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Role-playing Ideas</strong>: Characters with this Asset might be sensitive about it, or they might 
			simply be oblivious to its presence, having never known any different way of experiencing the world.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_Feral">Feral</p>
			<p><em>During at least your early infancy you were nurtured by wild animals, or you were raised under 
			conditions normal to wild beasts rather than even primitive humanity.</em></p>
			
			<p><strong>Good</strong>: You take –2 to TNs to Animal Ken and Survival, and –1 to TNs to Surprise and 
			Tracking Checks.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Poor</strong>: You take +1 on TNs to Custom Checks and for all social interaction, save 
			intimidation, and an additional +2 to TNs for social interactions under even remotely formal 
			circumstances.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Role-playing Ideas</strong>: The character might prefer the company of beasts to that of humans, 
			or avoid settlements and civilization as much as possible. He may at times resort to expressing himself 
			with snarls and growls.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_Focused">Focused</p>
			<p><em>You can keep your attention on a task, despite many distractions. However, events in the background 
			tend to pass you by.</em></p>
			
			<p><strong>Good</strong>: You gain a –3 TN modifier to ignore distractions and on Timed Checks to work on 
			some task under pressure.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Poor</strong>: You take a +2 TN modifier on Surprise Checks and on Checks to notice things which 
			are not actively looking out for.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Role-playing Ideas</strong>: Characters with this Asset often seem single-minded or even obsessive 
			in their focus on a specific task.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_Giant">Giant</p>
			<p><em>The character is abnormally huge, at least 25% and maybe up to 35% taller than the average for people 
			of like gender.</em></p>
			
			<p><strong>Good</strong>: The character’s Terrain Check TNs are reduced by 1. In addition, all his weapon 
			lengths in combat are increased by one increment, effectively allowing him to attack at Short with his bare 
			hands.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Poor</strong>: The character’s hulking frame lacks grace. The TNs for all Checks involving graceful 
			and agile body movement are increased by +1, including evasion Checks in combat.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Role-playing Ideas</strong>: Characters with this Asset are virtually unmistakable; use of the 
			Disguise Skill to imitate any normal-sized person is impossible, and for the reason of general disguise its 
			TNs are raised by +2.</p>
			
			<p><em>This Asset is appropriate for Degenerates.</em></p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_Hallucinations">Hallucinations</p>
			<p><em>Either because of a strangely mystical bent or a long history of heavy drug abuse, the character 
			suffers frequent hallucinations. These hallucinations arise from the character’s imagination, seem perfectly 
			real, and are devoid of any real prophetic content.</em></p>
			
			<p><strong>Good</strong>: There are no good aspects to Hallucinations.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Poor</strong>: In any scene, no matter whether the character is stressed or relaxed, with 11+ on a 
			d12 there is a chance of a disruptive hallucination occurring. Minor hallucinations of no consequence can 
			occur more frequently than this.</p>
			
			<p>What makes these attacks critical is that they instill in the character a belief that some instance 
			requires a reaction that will at best be awkward and alienate people, and at worst be downright dangerous.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Role-playing Ideas</strong>: Characters with this Asset have no way of telling whether a 
			hallucination is real or not; they must decide this alone and react, or refuse to react, based on their 
			judgment. This may lead to them taking an unexpected real event for a mere hallucination. The ref is 
			encouraged to roll twice for the occurrence of a hallucination in some scenes, and to forgo the roll in 
			others, so as to keep the player unsure about the absolute limit of one hallucination per scene.</p>
			
			<p><em>This Asset is appropriate for Decadents.</em></p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_HardOfHearing">Hard of Hearing</p>
			<p><em>You have a slight hearing impairment.</em></p>
			
			<p><strong>Good</strong>: There is no good aspect to the Hard of Hearing Asset.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Poor</strong>: You take a +2 TN modifier on all Checks related to hearing something.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Role-playing Ideas</strong>: Characters with this Asset maybe sensitive about it, or they might 
			simply be oblivious to its presence, having never known any different way of experiencing the world.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_Hardy">Hardy</p>
			<p><em>You are made of tougher stuff than the average person, but you’re not quite as quick to react to 
			dangers.</em></p>
			
			<p><strong>Good</strong>: You gain a -1 TN modifier for enduring physical hardships like torture. Your 
			Tenacity is treated as being 1 higher for the purpose of reducing Pain from wounds.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Poor</strong>: You take a +1 TN modifier on Reflex Checks, including those for Surprise.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Role-playing Ideas</strong>: Characters with this Asset might see their physical prowess as normal 
			and look down on less hardy individuals, or they might see it as their duty to play the role of protector and 
			help those less able to endure physical hardship.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_Hideous">Hideous</p>
			<p><em>The character is not just plain or ugly, but truly hideous.</em></p>
			
			<p><strong>Good</strong>: There is no good aspect to this Asset.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Poor</strong>: Any Checks for the character’s friendly social interactions with strangers or 
			passing acquaintances have their TNs increased by +2. Close acquaintances and friends have learned to look 
			past the revolting face and interact normally with the hideous character.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Role-playing Ideas</strong>: Plain scarification of the face is not sufficient to attain this 
			level of ugliness, which requires a birth defect or deliberate mutilation of the face. The character is sure 
			to become the subject of pity, but more likely of abuse, should people dare to abuse him.</p>
			
			<p><em>This Asset is appropriate for Degenerates.</em></p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_Honest">Honest</p>
			<p><em>You are naturally straightforward and sincere. This quality helps you win people to your viewpoint, but 
			you have difficulty telling lies and seeing deception in others.</em></p>
			
			<p><strong>Good</strong>: The character takes –2 TN on Checks to detect lies and on the Negotiation Skill, 
			provided he negotiates honestly. When telling the truth while somebody else is using Falsehood to ascertain 
			the truthfulness of a claim, this character takes –4 TN to the Check. People will generally be inclined to 
			believe the character’s claims.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Poor</strong>: The character takes +3 TN to successfully tell a lie or sniff out somebody else’s 
			lie. He takes +1 TN to all social Checks in situations in which he is hiding something.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Role-playing Ideas</strong>: Characters with this Asset maybe naive and too unsophisticated to lie, 
			or they might be aware of worldly matters and simply choose to take a higher ground.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_Hunchback">Hunchback</p>
			<p><em>The character’s spine is deformed in such a way that he is constantly bent forward significantly with 
			a prominent hunchback.</em></p>
			
			<p><strong>Good</strong>: There are no good aspects to the Hunchback Asset.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Poor</strong>: The difficulty of all the character’s Checks for action where fluidity and grace of 
			movement of the entire body are important (e.g. uses of the Skills Light Step, Dancing, or Climbing) have 
			their TN raised by +2. Evasion DTNs are raised by +1.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Role-playing Ideas</strong>: Apart from this malformation being considered unattractive by many 
			people, possibly causing discomfort or even pain, it affects the grace of the character’s movements.</p>
			
			<p><em>This Asset is appropriate for Degenerates.</em></p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_Inattentive">Inattentive</p>
			<p><em>You are skilled at finishing simple tasks, but you have a difficult time dealing with longer, more 
			complex tasks.</em></p>
			
			<p><strong>Good</strong>: You get a -2 TN to any Checks to notice things going on around you.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Poor</strong>: You take +3 TN to Timed Checks requiring prolonged concentration or dedication, and 
			+2 TN to notice things you are actively watching out or looking for.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Role-playing Ideas</strong>: Characters with this Asset might flit from subject to subject in 
			conversation, or they may seem normal. They leave their long-term projects perpetually unfinished.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_Indomitable">Indomitable</p>
			<p><em>The character can draw upon reserves of strength and resolve, but is prone to overextending 
			himself.</em></p>
			
			<p><strong>Good</strong>: For one Limelight per scene - or alternatively for a single, short task per scene - 
			the character can ignore all wound and fatigue penalties. He can only do so if he has taken at least a single 
			level 3 wound or a total of 4 wound levels during an ongoing fight, or is otherwise at a pronounced 
			disadvantage.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Poor</strong>: The character checks at +3 TN for the “It’s Just a Scratch” rule. If the rule is not 
			in use, the character must instead never surrender, no matter how insurmountable the odds.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Role-playing Ideas</strong>: The character may not know the meaning of quitting, or perhaps be too 
			plain dumb to know when he has lost – which could lead to his demise.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_Inhuman">Inhuman</p>
			<p><em>The character is akin to a demi-human species that preceded humankind. Possibly a distant strain 
			asserts itself in his genes, he is the product of some freak experiment of sorcerous crossbreeding, or the 
			fruit of an unsavory union in the not-too-distant past. Whatever he is, he is not entirely human.</em></p>
			
			<p><strong>Good</strong>: The character has some easily hidden bodily feature that sets him apart from the 
			rest of humanity (e.g. complete hairlessness, lack of body odor, absence of a navel, or something determined 
			in collaboration between the player and ref). In addition, he has some instinctive knowledge of his inhuman 
			ancestors and a strange rapport with them. The TNs of his Checks to know facts about them or to interact 
			successfully with them are decreased by –2.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Poor</strong>: The character not only has some conspicuous feature branding him as unusual (e.g. 
			extra digits, strange-looking eyes, an unusual complexion, something determined in collaboration between the 
			player and ref), he has also something about him that makes most people uneasy. The TNs of his social 
			interactions with Savages, Nomads and Hillmen are increased by +2, and by +1 for those with Civilized people. 
			Enlightened, Decadents, and Degenerates are unaffected. If the campaign does not use Cultural Archetypes, he 
			interacts with everybody at +1 TN.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Role-playing Ideas</strong>: This Asset can only exist in campaigns where an appropriate non-human 
			race exists at least in legend.</p>
			
			<p><em>This Asset is appropriate for Degenerates.</em></p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_KillerInstinct">Killer Instinct</p>
			<p><em>A predatory beast lurks within the character. He always goes for the kill.</em></p>
			
			<p><strong>Good</strong>: The character takes –1 Attack Target Number on melee attacks he makes with the 
			immediate intent to kill. This excludes all unarmed attacks, the Maneuvers Bind & Strike, Disarm, Hook, Stop 
			Short, and Toss, and attacks where the character is even remotely holding back.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Poor</strong>: The character pays double Activation Cost (minimum 1) for Bind & Strike, offensive 
			Disarm and Grapple, Hook, Stop Short, and Toss, and +1 Activation Cost (minimum 1) for all Defensive 
			Maneuvers other than Counter, Master-Strike, Overrun, and Rota.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Role-playing Ideas</strong>: The character may be a cold-blooded killer, or it might be as if 
			something deadly slumbers within him, yearning to be unleashed.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_Lame">Lame</p>
			<p><em>Somehow, maybe due to a wound or a birth defect, one of the character’s legs is either decidedly 
			shorter and / or weaker than the other.</em></p>
			
			<p><strong>Good</strong>: There are no good aspects to the Lame Asset.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Poor</strong>: All the character’s Checks for actions in which being lame in one leg might be a 
			detriment (the use of the Dancing, Climbing, or Light Step Skills, etc.) have their TNs raised by +2. In 
			combat, all three types of Evasion and any Maneuvers that include a great amount of stepping (Stop Short 
			and Evasive Attack, and others as the situation demands) have their TNs raised by +1.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Role-playing Ideas</strong>: The character walks with a very noticeable limp and is severely 
			handicapped in all endeavors where quick or sure steps are important.</p>
			
			<p><em>This Asset is appropriate for Degenerates.</em></p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_Lecherous">Lecherous</p>
			<p><em>Most heroes of S&S are very fond of wenching, but this character takes it to extremes.</em></p>
			
			<p><strong>Good</strong>: All the character’s TNs to win over somebody on whom he has cast an eye are reduced 
			by –2. This is not limited to the Seduction Skill alone, but can also apply to other actions (such as Acting, 
			Customs, Dancing, Etiquette, Music, among others) provided their main purpose is to impress the person the 
			character wants to bed.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Poor</strong>: The character is addicted to pretty faces. If he wants to avoid having to make 
			passes at every possible attractive partner he comes across (or at the most attractive one if encountering 
			several at once), he has to pass a TY Check. The ref adjudicates the difficulty of this Check by how sexually 
			sated the character is at the time; the eligibility of the possible partner; and the likely awkwardness of 
			such a pass. He will set it very rarely, if ever, below Challenging.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Role-playing Ideas</strong>: Characters with this Asset will scarcely pass up the opportunity 
			for a tryst with anyone sexually compatible.</p>
			
			<p><em>This Asset is appropriate for Decadents.</em></p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_LegendaryBeauty">Legendary Beauty</p>
			<p><em>The character is more than just being beautiful – his looks are singularly breathtaking.</em></p>
			
			<p><strong>Good</strong>: All Checks for friendly social interactions with sexually compatible people are 
			made against –1 TN, however, the character’s rolls for friendly social interaction with sexually 
			incompatible persons are made at +2 TN, as his good looks attract scorn and jealousy. (The character’s 
			close acquaintances are exempted from the latter modifier.) The ref may not use the character’s beauty 
			against him, so pestering him with unwanted attention of any kind because of his beauty, for example, would 
			be unacceptable. The character may be ravishing, but fate smiles upon him in such a way that he somehow 
			escapes special attention from slavers, powerful letches and the like.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Poor</strong>: The character will regularly attract unwanted attention from powerful but 
			obnoxious suitors, letches, slavers and others of the kind. As often as every other game session, the ref 
			may justifiably introduce an episode of potential danger that relates directly to the character’s beauty.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Role-playing Ideas</strong>: A character with this Asset could either be a happy-go-lucky social 
			mixer, used to getting his way; or a quiet and introverted soul, made shy by his own beauty.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_Literacy">Literacy</p>
			<p><em>In a setting where literacy is uncommon, the character can read and write. Where it is common, 
			he cannot.</em></p>
			
			<p><strong>Good</strong>: The character can read and write.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Poor</strong>: The character cannot read and write and is unable ever to learn, due to some 
			defect, a poor attention span or a plain dislike of “book lernin’”.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Role-playing Ideas</strong>: The Good aspect of the Asset is available only in campaigns where 
			few people are literate. In such a campaign characters without Literacy are automatically illiterate. The 
			Poor aspect of the Asset is only available in campaigns where few people are illiterate; in this case 
			characters without Literacy are automatically literate.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_Lithe">Lithe</p>
			<p><em>You are fast, but less sturdy than the average member of your race.</em></p>
			
			<p><strong>Good</strong>: You gain –2 TN for Reflex Checks, excluding Surprise Checks, and –1 TN for Checks 
			related to grace of movement, like Dancing and some types of DG Checks.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Poor</strong>: Your Knockdown score is reduced by 1, and Brawn Attribute is treated as 1 lower 
			for the sake of resisting blunt trauma.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Role-playing Ideas</strong>: Characters with this Asset typically try to stay away from physical 
			combat. However, a rare few might relish it, striving to see if their superior speed is sufficient for them 
			to get the better of hardier warriors.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_LostLove">Lost Love</p>
			<p><em>Somehow, somewhere, the character found and enjoyed what he is convinced was his one true love. 
			He has since irrevocably lost it.</em></p>
			
			<p><strong>Good</strong>: The character is virtually immune to any seduction attempts. He resists these 
			attempts at TN –4. Even if this resistance fails, he will only ever be carnally aroused, never smitten.</p>
			
			<p>He takes –2 TN to resist sorceries designed to make him fall in love or become victim to his lusts. He is 
			unfazed by good looks, so he would be sexually incompatible in the face of Assets such as Legendary Beauty.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Poor</strong>: The character suffers reflective bouts of depression and black moods. Such spells 
			befall him automatically when he witnesses closely other lovers’ happiness. They can also afflict him at 
			random.</p>
			
			<p>A spell of black mood is indicated if the ref rolls D12 with a result of 10+ at the onset of a new scene. 
			Such a bout, and its accompanying listlessness and acerbity, needs to be role-played with the mechanical 
			implications of+2 to the TNs of all the character’s attempts at friendly interaction.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Role-playing Ideas</strong>: Characters with this Asset could be firmly convinced that they 
			will always be unable to regain the happiness they once knew.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_MissingArm">Missing Arm</p>
			<p><em>The character is missing not only a hand; he has lost an entire arm or at least the greater 
			portion of it (from mid upper arm).</em></p>
			
			<p><strong>Good</strong>: There is no benefit to having lost an arm.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Poor</strong>: Too little is left of the lost arm to allow for any kind of effective prosthetic. 
			Most activities where a two-handed grip is necessary are impossible, but a few maybe attempted with steep 
			penalties.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Role-playing Ideas</strong>: Common sense will arbitrate the difficulties that result from having 
			only one arm. If it is the dominant arm the character has lost, it is given that he has already trained 
			himself to use his other arm without handicap.</p>
			
			<p><em>This Asset can only be taken in conjunction with Missing Hand.</em></p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_MissingHand">Missing Hand</p>
			<p><em>The character is missing one of his hands, possibly along with a small portion of his forearm.</em></p>
			
			<p><strong>Good</strong>: There is no benefit to having lost a hand.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Poor</strong>: There is enough left of the forearm for a crude prosthetic or to strap on a 
			specially adapted shield. However, any activity that necessitates the use of two hands (e.g. climbing) is 
			either heavily penalized or deemed impossible.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Role-playing Ideas</strong>: Common sense will arbitrate the difficulties that result from having 
			only one hand. If it is the dominant hand the character has lost, it is given that he has already trained 
			himself to use his other hand without handicap.</p>
			
			<p><em>This Asset may be combined with Missing Arm.</em></p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_Musclebound">Muscle-bound</p>
			<p><em>You are good at almost everything that requires strength, but you are less adept than most at tasks 
			that require coordination.</em></p>
			
			<p><strong>Good</strong>: Your Brawn is treated as 1 higher for the purpose of resisting Blunt and Cleaving 
			damage. You take -2 TN to any feat of raw strength.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Poor</strong>: You take +2 TN to feats requiring grace and agility.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Role-playing Ideas</strong>: Characters with this Asset are likely to solve problems with 
			physical strength rather than through trickery or finesse.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_Nearsighted">Nearsighted</p>
			<p><em>You have difficulty focusing on distant objects, however your near vision is more keen than 
			normal.</em></p>
			
			<p><strong>Good</strong>: You gain a -3 TN modifier on Checks related to spotting or discerning something at 
			close distances.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Poor</strong>: You have a +3 TN modifier on Checks related to spotting or discerning something at 
			mid to far ranges.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Role-playing Ideas</strong>: Characters with this Asset maybe sensitive about it, or they might 
			simply be oblivious to its presence, having never known a different way of experiencing the world.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_Necrophilia">Necrophilia</p>
			<p><em>The character is sexually attracted to fresh (or reasonably fresh) corpses.</em></p>
			
			<p><strong>Good</strong>: There are no good aspects to the Necrophilia Asset.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Poor</strong>: If the character is discovered to be a necrophiliac, most persons not sharing his 
			taste will be shocked and will cease dealing with him. Any roll for friendly social interaction by a known 
			necrophiliac has its TN raised by +1 to +3, the former for rather impersonal interactions like haggling, the 
			latter for eminently intimate ones like seduction.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Role-playing Ideas</strong>: The main impact of this affliction is that it has to be role-played. 
			However, should the character have the opportunity to engage in a sexual act with a corpse when it would be 
			impolitic to do so, he has to check Tenacity to resist his lust.</p>
			
			<p><em>This Asset is appropriate for Degenerates.</em></p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_NightSighted">Night-sighted</p>
			<p><em>Your eyes are particularly well suited to darkness, but they are less well adapted to what others 
			consider normal light.</em></p>
			
			<p><strong>Good</strong>: You must suffer the penalty to MP and Archery Pool from poor lighting that is one 
			step less severe than the actual circumstance.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Poor</strong>: You take +1 TN for all activities made in very bright light (at least equivalent to 
			a sunny day), and if fighting in such conditions, you lose 1 or 2 dice (ref’s call) from your MP and twice 
			as many from your Archery Pool.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Role-playing Ideas</strong>: This Asset may not affect a character’s personality at all, but it 
			might indicate a preference for underground or nighttime adventures.</p>
			
			<p><em>This Asset is appropriate for Degenerates.</em></p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_Obese">Obese</p>
			<p><em>You are pronouncedly overweight, weighing at least 30% more than is normal for your height.</em></p>
			
			<p><strong>Good</strong>: Your BN is treated as if it were 1 higher for the purpose of withstanding Blunt 
			and Cleaving damage.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Poor</strong>: Your obesity denotes 1 point Encumbrance, and you must use Encumbrance mechanics 
			even if the rest of the group doesn’t. Your Move Attribute is 1 lower than calculated.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Role-playing Ideas</strong>: The Obese character is often the comic relief in a tale. The classic 
			role-playing character model is Friar Tuck, a fat, bald and jovial monk with a great love of ale.</p>
			
			<p><em>This Asset is appropriate for Decadents.</em></p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_Overconfidence">Overconfidence</p>
			<p><em>The character thinks he is far more accomplished than reality dictates, and is more than ready to go 
			up against prohibitive odds.</em></p>
			
			<p><strong>Good</strong>: Any Check to resist being bullied, intimidated, frightened or cowed is made against 
			TN –2. The character takes –1 TN on all non-combat Opposed Checks made against any clearly superior opposition. 
			If fighting clearly superior odds, he pays 1 less Activation Cost for Offensive Maneuvers, provided his current 
			MP is greater than 0. If this takes the Activation Cost below 0, he gains +1 die on the attack.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Poor</strong>: Whenever the ref feels that the character is showing too much sound judgment, he can 
			ask for a Daring Check. The character must pass this test to prevent him throwing caution to the wind. The 
			difficulty of this Check is Average - if the opposition appears more than three times as formidable as the 
			character; Challenging – if more than twice as formidable; and Difficult - if only slightly more formidable.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Role-playing Ideas</strong>: Characters with this Asset should be constantly challenged by the ref. 
			Any situation where the character goes beyond passively following orders is ripe for a Check. This has to be 
			role-played to the hilt!</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_PantherReflexes">Panther Reflexes</p>
			<p><em>You are difficult to surprise and you strike your opponents with catlike speed. However, this Asset 
			also makes it more difficult for you to relax and interact with others.</em></p>
			
			<p><strong>Good</strong>: You gain a –2 TN modifier on Surprise Checks, Reflex Checks to determine initiative, 
			and Checks to Steal Initiative.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Poor</strong>: Due to your high-strung nature, you take a +2 TN modifier on most applications of 
			Customs, Etiquette, Information Gathering, and Seduction.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Role-playing Ideas</strong>: Characters with this Asset typically prefer operating as scouts when 
			seeking out the enemy. Any noise from companions is a distraction to his finely tuned instincts and reaction 
			time.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_Plodding">Plodding</p>
			<p><em>You are slow, but you are also sturdier than the average member of your race.</em></p>
			
			<p><strong>Good</strong>: You take -2 TN to Knockdown, with Brawn being treated as 1 higher for the sake of 
			withstanding blunt trauma.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Poor</strong>: You take +1 TN to Terrain Checks, Full Evasion, and Checks of the Move Attribute.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Role-playing Ideas</strong>: Characters with this Asset tend to be relatively immobile in combat. 
			They typically prefer to wear strong armor (or other protective devices), since it’s hard for them to flee a 
			fight.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_Plucky">Plucky</p>
			<p><em>You have a strength of will that is not reflected in your limited physical gifts.</em></p>
			
			<p><strong>Good</strong>: You take –1 TN on all TY Checks.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Poor</strong>: Your Knockout Attribute is 1 lower than calculated, and you take +1 TN on all 
			BN Checks.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Role-playing Ideas</strong>: Characters with this Asset maybe annoyingly optimistic, or they might 
			only show their mental resilience in times of dire need.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_Polite">Polite</p>
			<p><em>You are courteous and well spoken.</em></p>
			
			<p><strong>Good</strong>: You gain a -2 TN modifier on all Checks related to Negotiation and Etiquette, and a 
			–1 TN modifier on other social Checks in formal surroundings.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Poor</strong>: You take +3 TN on all Checks to pass yourself off as a member of the uncouth social 
			strata, and +2 TN to interact with such people in a friendly way, or to impress or intimidate them.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Role-playing Ideas</strong>: Characters with this Asset maybe honestly polite and kind, or they 
			might simply be adept at mimicking social conventions to get what they want.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_PrinceOfThieves">Prince of Thieves</p>
			<p><em>You are a consummate thief. Stealing is your calling and nature, and it is what really makes you 
			come alive.</em></p>
			
			<p><strong>Good</strong>: You take a –1 TN modifier for all Attribute and Skill Checks relating immediately 
			to tasks of stealth: stealing, filching, burglarizing, or breaking and entering.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Poor</strong>: Your many acts of thievery have made you a wanted man. As with a Connection Poor 
			Asset, others are willing to go to considerable lengths to damage or undo you.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Role-playing Ideas</strong>: You maybe boastful or slyly discreet about your status.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_Reckless">Reckless</p>
			<p><em>Your instincts dictate that you sacrifice accuracy to put more power behind your blows.</em></p>
			
			<p><strong>Good</strong>: For as long as your current MP is greater than 0, you pay 1 less Activation Cost 
			for Offensive Maneuvers. If this takes the Activation Cost below 0, you gain +1 die on the attack.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Poor</strong>: You pay a +1 Activation cost for defensive Maneuvers.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Role-playing Ideas</strong>: Characters with this Asset maybe loudly passionate about entering 
			combat and overcoming foes through strength of arms. Alternatively, they may be quiet and so desperate to 
			avoid confrontation that they put extra effort into every blow in an attempt to end an encounter more 
			quickly.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_Relentless">Relentless</p>
			<p><em>You don’t know the meaning of the word “tired.” You go all out until you simply can’t 
			continue.</em></p>
			
			<p><strong>Good</strong>: The character is at –2 TN to shrug off fatigue and keep going. This includes fatigue 
			Checks, if those optional rules are in use.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Poor</strong>: If the optional Fatigue rules are not in use, they are employed for this character 
			only. If in use, all the character’s fatigue Checks are at +3 TN.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Role-playing Ideas</strong>: Characters with this Asset may see others - especially those who 
			complain of tiredness or fatigue - as soft or weak. They might openly scoff at others’ weaknesses or encourage 
			them to “tough it out.”</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_Saddleborn">Saddleborn</p>
			<p><em>You are a natural in the saddle. However, you do not feel comfortable walking.</em></p>
			
			<p><strong>Good</strong>: You gain a –2 TN modifier on Riding and related Checks with one particular type of 
			riding beast. When mounted on this beast, your cap to your useable Proficiency for horse archery is 2 higher 
			than normal (i.e. Riding Skill +2).</p>
			
			<p><strong>Poor</strong>: You take +1 TN to Terrain Checks and +2 TN to Move Checks due to a horseman’s bent 
			legs and rolling gait.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Role-playing Ideas</strong>: Characters with this Asset rarely even consider walking any but the 
			shortest of distances.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_Sadism">Sadism</p>
			<p><em>The character enjoys witnessing and inflicting suffering and pain.</em></p>
			
			<p><strong>Good</strong>: There is no good aspect to the Sadism Asset.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Poor</strong>: If the character is discovered to be a sadist – and most of his closer associates 
			will discover it sooner or later – the more considerate will react with displeasure.</p>
			
			<p>Any Check for friendly social interaction by a known sadist usually has its TN raised by +1, or by +2 if 
			the person in question is particularly scrupulous. Persons who are callous themselves are unfazed by 
			sadism.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Role-playing Ideas</strong>: The primary impact of this Asset is on role-playing. The character 
			will never miss a public execution; he will press for the torturing of prisoners and regularly beat animals 
			and servants; etc. He may Check Tenacity to suppress his sadistic vein when it would be impolitic to follow 
			his cruel streak (for instance when the victim is somebody who might directly or indirectly seek vengeance, 
			or when the character’s urgent attention should be directed elsewhere). The difficulty of this Check depends 
			on the degree of awkwardness it would involve to indulge his sadism; on the period of abstinence; and on the 
			likelihood of an equivalent opportunity arising soon.</p>
			
			<p><em>This Asset is appropriate for Decadents and Degenerates.</em></p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_Shadow">Shadow</p>
			<p><em>You are a master at going unnoticed, however you may also be very nondescript.</em></p>
			
			<p><strong>Good</strong>: Whenever you try to remain unobserved or to vanish, you take a –2 TN modifier to 
			Light Step, Sneaking, Tracking, and Trailing and related Checks to this end.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Poor</strong>: You have an extremely hard time convincing somebody of any exceptional claims you 
			make, whether true or not. Take a +2 TN modifier to such tasks, as well as to Seduction Checks and attempts 
			at intimidation. If you mean to assume a position of leadership, you have to prove your worth to every 
			prospective follower, personally.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Role-playing Ideas</strong>: The character may take pleasure in his ability to startle others with 
			his talent to melt into and appear from the shadows, or he might purposely cultivate a low and innocuous 
			profile.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_Skinny">Skinny</p>
			<p><em>You are very slender for your race.</em></p>
			
			<p><strong>Good</strong>: You take a -2 TN modifier on all Checks related to agility, elusiveness, or moving 
			in confined spaces.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Poor</strong>: You take +2 TN to Knockdown, with Brawn being treated as 1 lower for the sake of 
			withstanding blunt trauma.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Role-playing Ideas</strong>: Skinny characters tend to be pushed around by tougher types, so those 
			with this Asset maybe shy, or they might be very defensive.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_Slippery">Slippery</p>
			<p><em>You are less adept at grappling and wrestling than others of your size and strength, however you are 
			adept at slipping out of another’s hold.</em></p>
			
			<p><strong>Good</strong>: You gain a -2 TN modifier on Checks to escape a grapple or avoid being grappled.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Poor</strong>: You take a +2 TN modifier on all other grapple Checks.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Role-playing Ideas</strong>: In the knowledge that they are less skillful grapplers than most 
			opponents, characters with this Asset may fear close combat. On the other hand, good escape artists with this 
			Asset might enjoy baiting larger foes into grappling them, knowing they can easily slip out of most 
			adversaries’ clutches.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_Specialized">Specialized</p>
			<p><em>You have a knack for one kind of work or study.</em></p>
			
			<p><strong>Good</strong>: You gain a –3 TN modifier on Checks of one specific craft, knowledge, or 
			professional Skill.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Poor</strong>: There are no poor aspects to the Specialized Asset.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Role-playing Ideas</strong>: Characters with this Asset often see themselves as elite artists or 
			experts rather than mere professionals, and they might regard their chosen vocation or study as more useful 
			or interesting than other tasks.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_Spell-gifted">Spell-gifted</p>
			<p><em>The character has a special flair for a certain sorcerous Mystery – and perhaps for nothing other than 
			the one Mystery. This Asset may only be chosen for characters created with an A-C Sorcery Priority.</em></p>
			
			<p><strong>Good</strong>: Having chosen a particular Greater or Lesser Mystery, you take –2 TN when using 
			that Mystery.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Poor</strong>: If your character is a Mysteriarch, choose four particular Greater or Lesser 
			Mysteries; if a Sorcerer, three; or if a Dabbler, one. You take +1 TN when using these Mysteries, or +3 TN 
			if a mere Dabbler.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Role-playing Ideas</strong>: The character may loudly extol the virtues of his preferred 
			sorceries – or try to keep secret his deficiency in the others.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_Stout">Stout</p>
			<p><em>You are heavy for your race.</em></p>
			
			<p><strong>Good</strong>: To account for your heaviness and the difficulty of your opponent’s task of driving 
			you back, you take -2 TN to Knockdown, with Brawn being treated as 1 higher for the sake of withstanding 
			blunt trauma.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Poor</strong>: You take a +2 TN modifier on all Checks related to agility, speed, or melee 
			Evasion.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Role-playing Ideas</strong>: Overweight characters are often bullied, so those with this Asset 
			may be shy, or they might be very defensive. Some turn to humor to defuse their feelings of awkwardness, 
			while others become bitter.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_Superstitious">Superstitious</p>
			<p><em>For good or bad, you have an unwavering belief in the power of the supernatural. You may be intrigued 
			by or afraid of it, or both.</em></p>
			
			<p><strong>Good</strong>: You may use an SY with twice the normal number of required successes instead of 
			Occultism, even if you do not have that Skill. You may choose one sorcerous Mystery to resist at –1 TN.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Poor</strong>: You resist all hostile sorcery at +1 TN. Any attack of yours against a known 
			sorcerer requires +1 Activation Cost (minimum 1).</p>
			
			<p><strong>Role-playing Ideas</strong>: The character maybe either unwholesomely fascinated by the 
			supernatural or afraid and distrustful of it. In any case he might carry a lot of charms and amulets.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_Suspicious">Suspicious</p>
			<p><em>You are naturally suspicious of everyone and everything. While this Asset makes you hard to fool, it 
			makes others more likely to find you unpleasant.</em></p>
			
			<p><strong>Good</strong>: You take a –2 TN modifier to all Checks to detect and see through lies. You oppose 
			Negotiation and Seduction at –1 TN, even if no untruthfulness is involved.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Poor</strong>: You take a +2 TN modifier on Checks related to friendly social interaction.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Role-playing Ideas</strong>: This Asset may express itself as comic levels of paranoia, or it might 
			make the character quietly cautious about others.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_Swindler">Swindler</p>
			<p><em>Lying, swindling, and obfuscating are not just a way of life to a character with this Asset; they are 
			his second nature.</em></p>
			
			<p><strong>Good</strong>: The character takes –2 TN to all Falsehood Checks to tell convincing lies, and –1 
			TN to Checks of Acting, Disguise, Negotiation, and Seduction, as well as of the HT and CG Attributes, 
			provided telling or projecting an untruth is a significant part of the activity that is Checked.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Poor</strong>: The character constantly tells major, minor, and petty lies. This becomes apparent 
			to anybody who knows him for even the shortest time and to those who have heard of him.</p>
			
			<p>Against such characters, the character takes either +1 TN or +2 TN on Checks for all activities where 
			being perceived as honest matters, depending on the degree to which truthfulness is a key issue. This does 
			include, amongst more readily apparent things, uses of Seduction, Negotiation, and many uses of HT and CG 
			for plain social interaction.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Role-playing Ideas</strong>: Somebody with this Asset may be a habitual and even compulsive liar, 
			possibly aggrandizing himself at every possible and impossible opportunity. He might also be a sly and 
			shifty individual who makes a living off the gullible – whom he might despise.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_Torpid">Torpid</p>
			<p><em>You are sluggish and slow to react to danger, but also resistant to others’ commands.</em></p>
			
			<p><strong>Good</strong>: You gain a –2 TN modifier to resist the Enslavement Mystery and similar sorcerous 
			effects of command and befuddlement.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Poor</strong>: You take a +2 modifier to TNs to notice and react to any kind of hidden danger, 
			including Surprise Checks.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Role-playing Ideas</strong>: Torpid characters may be seen as lazy, or as methodical and 
			measured in their actions.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_ToughAsNails">Tough as Nails</p>
			<p><em>You are made of sterner stuff than the average person.</em></p>
			
			<p><strong>Good</strong>: Take –1 TN to healing Checks and Checks to resist and recover from poison, and to 
			“It’s Just a Scratch” Checks, if those are used.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Poor</strong>: There is no poor aspect to the Tough as Nails Asset.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Role-playing Ideas</strong>: Characters with this Asset maybe gruff and place extreme value on 
			overcoming physical ailments.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_Uncivilized">Uncivilized</p>
			<p><em>You relate better to animals than you do to people.</em></p>
			
			<p><strong>Good</strong>: You gain a -3 TN to Checks of the Animal Ken Skill and –1 TN to Checks of Riding, 
			and to Tracking if it is related to animals.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Poor</strong>: You take a +2 TN modifier on Checks related to Etiquette, Negotiation, and 
			Information Gathering, and to all social Checks made in even moderately refined surroundings.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Role-playing Ideas</strong>: Characters with this Asset are likely to feel awkward in many social 
			situations. This might be expressed as shyness and quiet behavior, or through an overly exuberant need to 
			participate in conversations.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_Wastrel">Wastrel</p>
			<p><em>The character either does not care at all about hanging on to money or else he is spectacularly bad 
			at it.</em></p>
			
			<p><strong>Good</strong>: There is no benefit to being a wastrel.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Poor</strong>: When other characters do not have to roll a Check for a decrease in Loot between 
			one session and the next, this character must roll. When others must Check, his Challenge Level is 
			(7 - Loot). He also takes +3 TN to all Checks to buy at a good price (not to sell).</p>
			
			<p><strong>Role-playing Ideas</strong>: Characters with this Asset allow wealth to slip through their 
			fingers at an incredible pace.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_Wordbound">Wordbound</p>
			<p><em>The character feels bound always to keep his word – either because of a sense of honor, or possibly 
			because of some sorcery.</em></p>
			
			<p><strong>Good</strong>: If the PC pledges himself to pursue or eschew a certain course of action, this is 
			treated like an Omen rating 1 (see the Prophecy Mystery) applicable to all Checks made to honor his word.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Poor</strong>: If the PC pledges himself to pursue or eschew a certain course of action, this is 
			treated like an Omen rating 1 working against all the Checks he makes breaking his word. The ref will make 
			sure that the PC is frequently faced with situations where he is asked, enticed or forced to make pledges 
			he doesn’t want to keep.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Role-playing Ideas</strong>: The character may take strength from his innate sense of honor, or he 
			might be afraid of the consequences of breaking an oath, or he may be under some sorcerous compulsion.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_Zealot">Zealot</p>
			<p><em>The character adheres to very clear-cut and uncompromising morals. He is absolutely convinced that 
			his moral standards are correct and is unable and unwilling to view moral questions other than in terms of 
			black and white.</em></p>
			
			<p><strong>Good</strong>: The character takes –2 TN to all his Checks to shrug off mental and physical 
			hardship while pursuing what he perceives to be right in the face of opposition.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Poor</strong>: The character takes +1 TN to all his Checks while doing something he considers 
			morally wrong.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Role-playing Ideas</strong>: Characters with this Asset will often be harsh and uncompromising in 
			their judgments. They may take silent strength from their convictions or be haunted and driven by them.</p>
