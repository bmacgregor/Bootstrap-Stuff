			<p class="h2">Passion Attributes</p>
			<p>Passion Attributes mirror things that are important to the character, but they comprise first and foremost 
			that which is important to the player. Within the constraints of his character’s fictional personality, the 
			player sets whatever he wants as Passion Attributes.</p>
			
			<p>The constraint of the character’s personality will mean that a Passion Attribute has to concur with 
			something the character wants, likes or dislikes.</p>
		</div>
	</div>

	<div class="container text-justify">
		<div>
			<p class="h4">Passion Attributes</p>
			<p>Passions need not be identical to the character’s personality description. The Passion Attributes are a way for 
			the player to signal to his ref what he would like to have adventures about. Together with making the character 
			more – almost cinematically – efficient in these adventures, these are the most important functions of the 
			Passion Attribute.</p>
			
			<p>A player may, for instance, create a character with a fierce hatred of slavery as one of his central 
			personality traits. However, if the player is not interested in leading his character through adventures in 
			which he would regularly contend with slavery and slavers, the player need not (and indeed should not) turn 
			this hatred of slavery into a Passion Attribute as this attribute would simply sit in the background, adding 
			color to the character’s personality and certainly impacting the way he is role-played, but not be a central 
			issue in his adventures.</p>
			
			<p>Only items that a player wants to figure heavily in his character’s adventures should ever be made into 
			Passion Attributes. Should a player ever wish to change the focus of his character’s adventures, he may just 
			change one or more of his Passion Attributes.</p>
			
			<p>Doing so is permissible even in the middle of a session. The sole constraint of the new Passion Attribute 
			is a degree of plausibility. If it is sufficiently plausible within the framework of the character’s 
			established personality that a new Passion Attribute is warranted, the change is allowed. This process is not 
			adjudicated by the referee, but by the entire group <em>communally</em>; the ref has no more say than anyone 
			else at the table. If the group approves of the change, the player needs only to drop the Passion Attribute to 
			be changed down to a score of 0, and spend 1 point from any other Passion Attribute to effect the change. In 
			the case when a Passion Attribute has run its course and attained its subject, the player may reduce it to 0 
			and then change it to another Passion Attribute at no cost or point reallocation from another. This is only 
			possible if the new Passion can be regarded as one that develops naturally from the old, attained one.</p>
			
			<p>For example, if a PC attains the Passion: Become High-Priest of Set, the Passion: Have the Worship of Set 
			Elevated to State Religion would be a logical and free new Passion, but Passion: Win the Love of the Queen of 
			Aquilonia wouldn’t (unless it was previously made clear that becoming high-priest was only a stepping stone 
			for getting close to the queen).</p>
			
			<p>Whether a new Passion is a logical extension of the old one is again adjudicated by the group as a whole, 
			not by the referee. The score of a Passion Attribute advances by engaging it in play. Every time the character 
			takes a considerable risk (e.g. enters combat) or accepts a considerable disadvantage (e.g. alienating powerful 
			people) to either further or defend one of his Passion Attributes, he is immediately awarded a single point in 
			the pertinent Attribute. Also, if the Passion Attribute represents a goal (e.g. freeing somebody or attaining 
			something), every time the character by his own efforts takes a significant step towards the realization of 
			this goal, he is awarded a single point. How many points are gained each session in this way depends on a 
			group’s tastes, but we think that it shouldn’t be less than 3 or more than 6.</p>
			
			<p>The flip side is that the score of Passion Attributes can – rarely – also decrease. Every time a character 
			acts grossly against one his Passion Attributes (e.g. trafficking in slaves if he has a Passion Attribute of 
			hatred for slavery), or alternatively fails to follow up on an obvious opportunity to draw nearer to a goal, 
			he immediately loses a point from the Passion Attribute in question.</p>
			
			<p>Passion Attributes may not be kept secret from one’s fellow players, even if they represent some secret 
			goal of the PC. Any player is entitled at any time to know the Passion Attributes of all his fellow players. 
			In fact, this kind of knowledge is strongly advised and encouraged, as Passions can and should be used to tie 
			the individual PCs together into a group.</p>
			
			<p>Protagonists of Sword & Sorcery fiction are often loners and outcasts, headstrong and callous individuals 
			governed mainly by self-interest. Such persons do not form well or naturally into the traditional kind of 
			adventuring group. Instead, some plausible reason for such PCs’ cooperation needs to be found, and the most 
			plausible is, of course, mutual benefit. Passion Attributes, often representing a character’s goals and drives, 
			are an excellent tool to this end. By ensuring that all PCs have one or more Passion Attribute compatible with, 
			or similar to, each other, the group will be given coherence.</p>
			
			<div class="panel-body bg-warning" id="DIV_Example_GroupPassions">			
				<p><em><strong>Example</strong>: Some of the goals of the various PCs of such a group will complement 
				each other, and the PCs will have good reason to cooperate. PC A might, for example, have the Passion: 
				Hate for Sultan Zafra of Samara, PC B the Passion: Become Sultan of Samara, and PC C the Passion: Destroy 
				Cult of Baraz (the main protector and adherent of which happens to be Sultan Zafra). Without the three 
				Passions being identical, any adventure in which Sultan Zafra is the opponent or in which Sultan Zafra 
				stands to suffer will engage the Passion Attributes of all three characters, giving them a reason to stay 
				together.</em></p>
			</div>
			
			<br/>
			
			<p>The recommended method of establishing a link between PCs by means of Passion Attributes is communal 
			character creation, where all players are present when everybody else’s character is being created, and where 
			everybody may make suggestions and throw out ideas.</p>
			
			<p>While this is the best method of establishing a strong link that does not appear contrived, communal 
			character creation will unfortunately not always be possible. If it isn’t, it can be substituted by leaving 
			one of the four Passion Attribute slots of every participating PC undefined. This free slot should be filled 
			during the first session with a Passion that makes the PCs collaborators of convenience, tying them together 
			into the semblance of a group.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_Drama">Drama</p>
			<p>Drama is the great wild card of all the Passion Attributes, and much of what has been said above does not 
			apply to it. Every PC has it, it can never be exchanged for another Passion Attribute, and it does not 
			represent a facet of his personality. It is rather a mechanical representation, an extra bit of heroic 
			capability, and sometimes even luck. It is the player’s means to influence game events directly, above and 
			beyond his character’s actions, and it can be used in several ways:</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_LuckyBreak">Lucky Break</p>
			<p>A point of Drama can be spent to effect some specific change in the game world, usually one that is 
			beneficial to the character for which the Drama is expended.</p>
			
			<div class="panel-body bg-warning" id="DIV_Example_GroupPassions">			
				<p><em><strong>Example</strong>: One of the jailers of the dungeon into which the PC is thrown turns out to 
				be a buddy of the PC from his mercenary days. The kennel master has this evening forgotten to turn loose 
				the guardian lions roaming the compound the PC is breaking into at night. The daughter of the chieftain of 
				the barbarian tribe whose aid the PC needs takes a romantic interest in the PC.</em></p>
			</div>
			
			<br/>
			
			<p>The lucky break can be quite substantial. It should not, however, solve some problem for the PC outright. 
			Instead, it should provide an excellent opening for the PC to solve the problem himself. The specifics of the 
			lucky break are up to the player expending the Drama, but the referee need not accept any wish of the player’s. 
			The referee is encouraged to go with the flow and allow the lucky break the player desires, even if it should 
			be immensely advantageous, but he is not required to do so. He can refuse it, especially if he finds that a 
			certain lucky break would defuse the entire adventure.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_SceneRequest">Scene Request</p>
			<p>A point of Drama can be spent to request a certain scene from the referee. For details about this, see 
			Chapter Five.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_HaveSuccess">Have a Success</p>
			<p>A point of drama can be spent in a non-combat situation to achieve a considerable success on a Check 
			without the need to roll the dice. Instead of rolling the dice, the player expends a point of Drama. The 
			result is treated as if a number of dice out of his pool had turned up as successes, as per the following table. 
			However, the choice to forego a Check and spend Drama must be made before the dice are resorted to. Once a 
			Check has been rolled, its result stands.</p>
			
			<p class="h4">Have a Success</p>
			<table class="table table-striped table-hover" id="TBL_HaveASuccess">
				<tbody>
					<tr>
						<td>One to Four Dice</td>
						<td>All Successful</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Five to Seven Dice</td>
						<td>All but One Successful</td>

					<tr>
						<td>Eight to Ten Dice</td>
						<td>All but Two Successful</td>

				</tbody>
			</table>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_StealLimelight">Stealing the Limelight</p>
			<p>A point of Drama can be spent to change a combat’s Order of Limelights. For details about this, see 
			Chapter Four.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_MeleeSurvival">Optional Drama Use : Melee Survival</p>
			<p>If the group so desires, it can allow a point of Drama to be spent to reduce the effects of a wound that 
			would either kill a PC outright or incapacitate him to die soon. Such Drama expenditure invariably 
			incapacitates the PC, but also ensures his survival. The referee may not rule that the incapacitated PC is 
			dispatched by his victorious enemies. He is, however, encouraged to come up with some other nasty consequence 
			for the character. What this is depends entirely on the situation.</p>
			
			<p>He may be captured by his victorious enemies, or his body may be looted of some important possession, or he 
			may receive a nasty and lasting scar. The referee should be creative, but should avoid imposing something on 
			the PC that ruins the player’s continued fun.</p>
			
			<p>The injury suffered is only assigned a definite Wound Level once the PC regains consciousness. This should 
			usually be a Level 4, but it can be Level 3.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_UseByNPC">Drama Use by NPC's</p>
			<p>NPC's, even the most important ones, without exception never have Passion Attributes. This includes Drama. 
			There is, however, a way by which a referee can enjoy the equivalent of spending a point of Drama for one of 
			his NPC's.</p>
			
			<p><strong>When he wants an NPC to have a Lucky Break, Have a Success, or Melee Survival (if this optional rule 
			is being used), he may announce this and offer a single point of Drama to the player of any PC involved in the 
			current scene.</p>
			
			<p>If the player accepts, he gets the Drama point, and the NPC gets the benefit, but if he refuses, the referee 
			may ask any other player whose character is involved in the scene, and so on, until a player either accepts 
			the deal or all have declined it.</strong></p>
			
			<p>The order in which the referee asks the players is entirely up to him. A savvy referee will, of course, use 
			this discretion to best effect to get his desired Drama use. After all, the instinct of the player asked first 
			might be to decline, but then he can’t be sure that one asked later will not accept anyway, in which case he 
			will have foregone a point of Drama for nothing.</p>
			
			<p>In any case, the referee can resort to this mechanic no more often than once per scene – in total (not once 
			per scene per NPC). Drama is not raised like the other Passion Attributes, but may be gained in the way 
			outlined above, or through any of the following three ways.</p>
			
			<p><strong>First</strong>, any time you make the whole group laugh or impress them with an outstandingly fine 
			plan, idea, or dramatic piece of role-play you immediately gain one point. This specifically includes hearty 
			and full-mouthed quips made by the PCs in the face of danger or after overcoming it. Spit-spraying assertions 
			of the kind quoted throughout this book are, after all, a mainstay of the genre.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Second</strong>, if a player achieves a spectacular and unexpected success on any Check in the 
			course of one session, he gains one point at the close of that session. If several players qualify, the point 
			goes to the one with the most impressive success, as decided by the group.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Third</strong>, any player who has rolled a spectacularly poor Check during the session gets a 
			“consolation point” at this session’s end. If several players qualify, the point is, again, awarded the player 
			decided upon by the group. No more than 3 Drama points may be gained by any player in any one session.</p>
			
			<p>Finally, one can also transfer points to (but not from) the Drama Attribute. At the very beginning and the 
			very end of a session, all players have the opportunity to exchange any number of points from any of their 
			Passion Attributes to points in the Drama Attribute (maximum of 5), at a rate of a point for a point.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_SpendingPassion">2. Spending Passion Points</p>
			<p>Chapter One outlined a number of ways to use Passion Attributes. Using Passion Attribute points does not 
			deplete them in any way; they can be applied as bonus dice again and again. Spending Passion Attribute points 
			is different.</p>
			
			<p>All other traits increase by permanently spending Passion Attribute Points. These points, once spent, are 
			lost - and may only be regained through play (as described above). When spending these points, they may come 
			in any quantity from any combination of Passion Attributes.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_Karma">3. Karma</p>
			<p>Another aspect of spending Passion Attribute points is Karma. One point of Karma is gained every time you 
			spend one Passion Attribute point. These points come into play after your character dies or leaves the game, 
			allowing you to build a stronger new character.</p>
			
			<p>When you are creating a new character (whether the last one died or was simply “retired”), the player may 
			spend any number of his Karma points for better choices on the Talent Table, as per Table 13.</p>
			
			<p class="h4">Karma Rewards</p>
			<table class="table table-striped table-hover" id="TBL_KarmaRewards">

			<p>Higher Karma grants additional “Priorities” (see Chapter Two) for character creation. Thus, instead of one 
			Priority A, B, C and so on, you may begin with one Priority A, two Priority B’s, one C, D and so on. Karma is 
			not so much earned and amassed by the <em>character</em>, as earned and amassed by the <em>player</em> through 
			his character. It is the players to spend or hoard over several characters. If the player’s current character 
			dies or retires permanently and the player creates another character, even for a different campaign, he can 
			spend part or all of his Karma to create a new and better character. Karma that the player does not spend is 
			retained by him and noted on the appropriate space of the new character’s sheet.</p>
			
			<p>Karma is even earned by the ref, most likely in greater quantity than any other player in his group. Every 
			session, the ref receives Karma points equal to the player who earned the most Karma during the session. These 
			points are not so much rewards for being the ref, but rather a safeguard against the ref being left behind 
			should he one day become a player himself. He can then use his amassed Karma to create a stronger character 
			for himself, just as his former players did, who earned Karma while he was directing the game.</p>
