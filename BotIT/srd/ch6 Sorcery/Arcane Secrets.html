			<p class="h2">Arcane Secrets</p>
			<p>The final layer of magic is the Arcane Secrets of ancient sages, single, incredible acts of sorcery 
			transcending the limits of any single Mystery. Arcane Secrets are just that – secret, only whispered in occult 
			circles, legends about what this or that famous sorcerer was able to accomplish. Not even the most powerful 
			sorcerer of yore knew all of them, and most of these legendary masters of eldritch power probably knew only a 
			handful. Still, this was enough to make them the stuff of legend.</p>
			
			<p>With sorcery being no science, no Arcane Secret can ever be researched, and no new one can be discovered, 
			not if a thousand lifetimes were spent on this pursuit. Sorcerers desiring to learn one of these legendary acts 
			of sorcery must track down a source where it might be obtained. One possible source is the most powerful living 
			sorcerers, who might, just might, know a few of them – though getting them to impart this knowledge is a 
			different matter.</p>
		</div>
	</div>
	<!-- Jumbotron ends here -->
	
	<!-- Content begins here -->
	<div class="container text-justify">
		<div>
			<p class="h4">Arcane Secrets Overview</p>
			<p>Another source is demonic beings of immense power, which might be prevailed upon to share their knowledge – 
			or perhaps not. The innermost circles of some cults or secret societies, usually of the more unwholesome 
			variety, might also guard knowledge of one or two Arcane Secrets.</p>
			
			<p>Another possible source are the shades of dead legendary sorcerers rumoured to have possessed such knowledge, 
			though their deceased consciousness will often be too fractured to give anything more but telling hints – if 
			they can be summoned at all.</p>
			
			<p>The most uncommon and rarest source are written ones, often not so much in the form of books, but rather 
			things like inscriptions in some sanctum of an accursed temple – sorcerers being a jealous lot, most who manage 
			to track down a written source will destroy it to prevent others from ever profiting from it. Needless to say, 
			tracking down Arcane Secrets opens up an avenue of adventure of sorcerer PCs.</p>
			
			<p>To be able to learn any Arcane Secrets at all, a sorcerer must be proficient in at least one Greater 
			Mystery. There may well be other prerequisites, such as skill in a specific Greater or Lesser Mystery, but 
			practical knowledge of a Greater Mystery is always a prerequisite, even without being noted specifically. The 
			following is a selection of Arcane Secrets, to give refs a feeling for the scope of what they can accomplish. 
			Refs are encouraged not only to customise the names of these Arcane Secrets, but also to disallow any or all of 
			them, or to create additional ones, as fits their campaign.</p>
			
			<p>The total number of Arcane Secrets existing in any one setting is of course up to the ref, but to us anything 
			under 5 seems miserly and anything over 20 much too lavish.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_Abomination">Abomination</p>
			<p><em>Prerequisites: Goety & Mending</em></p>
			<p>This hours long extended ritual must be conducted, with slight alterations, every week during about the 
			first third of the pregnancy over the body of a woman who is either a willing participant or else powerless to 
			resist. It changes the embryo into some monstrosity, whose eventual birth will almost certainly kill the 
			mother.</p>
			
			<p>When the abomination is born, the sorcerer Checks the worse of his Goety or Mending pool to determine how 
			much demonic energy he was able to infuse into the unborn, spending his Successes on this unopposed Check to 
			purchase changes in the infant. For every Success, he may either: Increase human minimum, average and maximum 
			value of one Attribute by +2 or impart one useful feature like horns, fangs, poison, functional wings, up to 2 
			points of natural Armor Value, etc., or grant an Asset.</p>
			
			<p>By default, without spending any Successes, the abomination will always have –1 SY, –1 HT, and +2 BN, and it 
			will always look decidedly inhuman and bestial. Actual looks depend on what essence the sorcerer infused into 
			the embryo; the abomination will always have clear visual traits of one species of animal or legendary creature: 
			in some settings, this Arcane Secret may be tied to imparting a specific essence, with all abominations looking 
			similar; for example, a setting-specific Abomination Arcane Secret may be called “Son of the Bull” and always 
			produce minotaur-like creatures.</p>
			
			<p>In any case, the abomination will grow into adulthood at about five times the speed of a human – and it will 
			only be as loyal to its creator as the sorcerer is able to make it by any means at his disposal.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_AcolytesClaw">The Acolyte's Claw</p>
			<p><em>Prerequisites: Goety & Mending</em></p>
			<p>This Arcane Secret is no sorcerous spell at all, but rather a supremely deadly martial art harnessing the 
			sorcerer’s eldritch power into smooth movements and devastating blows. It is usable only for hand strikes and 
			Maneuvers conducted with the empty hands, and for Evasion hand parries – which are possible without any chance 
			of harm to the arm even against weapons. For all these actions, the Melee Pool consists of Reflex + Brawling + 
			Goety.</p>
			
			<p>Depending on the group’s preferences for the setting, the hand strikes take one the following two forms:</p>
			
			<ol>
				<li>The hand hits with Blunt Damage Rating +1 and causes additional Shock equal to the Wound Level</li>
				
				<li>The hand hits with Piercing Damage Rating - 1 or Cleaving Swing Damage Rating 0, and all Armor Values 
				protect against it at only quarter value – the sorcerer practically reaches through the armor and into the 
				body</li>
			</ol>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_AnimateTheDead">Animate the Dead</p>
			<p><em>Prerequisite: Necromancy</em></p>
			<p>With this ritual lasting 30 minutes to an hour, the sorcerer can animate a dead body to a semblance of life 
			and thereby create an undead. This Arcane Secret is intended to work on embalmed mummies and reasonably fresh 
			corpses still physically largely intact, but may in some settings also work on largely decomposed corpses. If 
			this is the case, such animated skeletons do not receive the +1 BN of other animated corpses (see below). To 
			create a classic shambling corpse or skeleton: Such undead are almost mindless (equivalent of SY 1) and without 
			memory or personality, but very loyal to their creator, whose commands they are unable to resist.</p>
			
			<p>They have the same Attributes as when alive, but both their HT and TY are limited by their SY score, thus 
			usually being 1 (in any case, HT is only applicable to animated corpses that are not obviously dead). Animated 
			dead receive –1 Move and +1 BN and are completely immune against Blood Loss, and virtually so against Pain; 
			instead of subtracting TY from Pain, all their Pain is flat out reduced by 10.</p>
			
			<p>To animate the corpse, the sorcerer’s Necromancy pool is checked. A single Success creates an undead, and the 
			sorcerer may spend his additional Successes to purchase:</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Limited reasoning capacity for the undead – every Success spent grants +1 SY</li>
				
				<li>Great strength and ferocity – every Success spent grants +1 BN and +1 Proficiency</li>
				
				<li>Skill at arms – every Success spent grants 3 Proficiency points (maximum 9)</li>
				
				<li>Increased durability – every Success spent increases the life expectancy of the undead by a factor of 
				ten (base is one year)</li>
				
				<li>Multiple undead – a sorcerer can animate any number of corpses at once. He has to expend the Successes 
				for the most powerful or durable undead, with every additional undead requiring only 1 Success, even though 
				it may be of equal power as the first one. With 6 casting Successes, a sorcerer could therefore animate 6 
				“basic” undead, or 5 undead with BN +1 and Proficiency +1 (2 Successes for first one and 1 Success for 
				every additional one)</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>For as long as the corpse is animated, it will not continue to decay.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_BindTheSoul">Bind the Soul</p>
			<p><em>Prerequisite: Necromancy</em></p>
			<p>This Arcane Secret forces a dead person’s soul into a body, in the process evicting the owner’s soul. To 
			conduct this hour-long ritual, the sorcerer must first conjure a deceased person’s soul, as normal for the 
			Mystery of Necromancy. Instead of questioning the soul, he instead conducts the ritual, anchoring the conjured 
			soul in another’s body.</p>
			
			<p>During the ritual, the host body must be conscious and either a willing participant (unlikely) or else 
			restrained. The sorcerer makes a Casting Check with his Necromancy pool, which both the inserted soul and the 
			body’s owner may resist with HT. If either the victim or the soul is victorious or ties the sorcerer, the 
			sorcery fails and the soul returns to whatever place souls inhabit in the afterlife.</p>
			
			<p>If the sorcerer however wins both Opposed Checks, the host body’s soul is driven out and passes irrevocably 
			into the afterlife, as if the body had died, and the inserted soul now inhabits the body, until the body dies 
			and the soul returns, once again, to the afterlife.</p>
			
			<p>If a sorcerer happens also to know Animate the Dead, he can substitute a dead (and thus soulless) animated 
			body for a living one. The animated corpse will then function with the SY of the soul inhabiting it, and will 
			be unable to disobey the sorcerer’s direct orders, as is normal for animated corpses.</p>
			
			<p>If the sorcerer uses the conjured soul’s own body, the animation of the corpse last indefinitely – the soul 
			from then on inhabits an undead but deathless body, potentially forever. Forcing a deceased’s soul back into a 
			body will most likely result in a deranged version of the original person. The more Casting Successes the 
			sorcerer achieves, the more likely will the resulting compound of soul and body to be sane.</p>
			
			<p>Achieving but a single Success signifies total and utter madness, with more Successes making the resulting 
			being increasingly normal; 6 Successes are required for complete sanity.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_Blight">Blight</p>
			<p><em>Prerequisites: Goety & Cursing</em></p>
			<p>In a ritual of roughly one hour’s duration, the sorcerer curses a land and afflicts it with a terrible 
			blight. A single “unit” of land with either geographical (e.g. a valley or an island) or political (e.g. a 
			county or a city state) boundaries of up to about 5.000 km² can be affected. The sorcerer makes the Casting 
			Check with the worse of Goety and Cursing.</p>
			
			<p>Every Success reduces the yield of next harvest by about a third, applicable to all agricultural produce 
			either animal or vegetal; 3 Successes therefore destroy a harvest utterly. Any Successes over 3 either extend 
			the duration by doubling the number of harvests destroyed or (caster’s choice) doubles the number of adjacent 
			“units” of land affected, or a combination thereof. 7 Successes will for example utterly destroy the next 
			sixteen harvests, or this harvest for sixteen regions, or any combination.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_ChariotOfSorcery">Chariot of Sorcery</p>
			<p><em>Prerequisites: Goety & Necromancy</em></p>
			<p>By means of this ritual the sorcerer permanently enchants some kind of vehicle over the course of one week to 
			one month of labour. With 1 Success on the Casting Check (made with the worse of either Goety or Necromancy SP) 
			the vehicle may be the size of a chariot, palanquin or rowboat. Additional Successes can be expended to allow 
			for larger vehicles: 1 additional Success allows for a vehicle the size of a carriage or small sailboat, 2 for 
			one the size a very small ship, 3 for one the size of small to mid-sized ship, etc.</p>
			
			<p>Successes can also be expended to purchase sorcerous qualities for the vehicle. 1 Success may purchase:</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>An untiring crew or team</li>
				
				<li>The capability to move without crew or team (requires an untiring crew having been purchased)</li>
				
				<li>An unusual type of locomotion (e.g. flying, diving, or burrowing) at a reasonable base speed</li>
				
				<li>Being faster than normal by 50% (per Success)</li>
				
				<li>Being bigger on the inside than on the outside by 50% (per Success)</li>
				
				<li>Locomotion for a structure that isn’t a vehicle (e.g. a walking hut)</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>The vehicle will always be most conspicuously sorcerous in nature. If the sorcerer desires that it look 
			mundane and innocuous, he is obliged to spend 1 Casting Success to purchase such an appearance. Usually, the 
			vehicle can only utilize its sorcerous means of locomotion if the sorcerer who has created it is on board, 
			though it may be appropriate for some settings to allow any sorcerer of sufficient might to control the 
			craft.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_EldritchEffigies">Eldritch Effigies</p>
			<p><em>Prerequisites: Goety & Enslavement</em></p>
			<p>By use of this sorcerous ritual of a single Limelight duration, the sorcerer splits himself into as many 
			versions of himself as he achieves Casting Successes. Depending on the setting these new versions of himself 
			may either step out of him or simply appear in his vicinity. The simulacra must stay in each others’ presence. 
			While they need not engage in identical activities, they can only engage in similar activities. 
			If one engages in conversation, the others must speak as well or at least look at the interlocutor. 
			If one is resting, the others must not run or walk around. If one is fighting, the others must fight as well 
			(not necessarily the same opponent) or at least circle an opponent warily. If one is reading, the others may 
			not sleep, or run around, or fight, or chat. While the effigies do not have to move in identical ways what they 
			are doing needs to somehow mirror what all the others are doing. The exception to this is that it is always 
			possible for the sorcerer to will one or more effigies remain completely passive.</p>
			
			<p>Effigies are completely real and can be interacted with in any way a human can. This extends to their 
			clothing and personal effects, though these can neither be given nor wrested away. Should some possession 
			somehow pass from an effigy, both effigy and item immediately dissolve, unless it is the effigy currently 
			housing the sorcerer’s essence (see below), in which case the possession passes from the effigy – and also 
			vanishes from all others.</p>
			
			<p>While all the effigies are the sorcerer, and equally real and equally sorcerous in nature, only one holds 
			the sorcerer’s essence at any given time. Which one is utterly indiscernible, and the sorcerer may change this 
			instantly, at a thought. Theoretically, he could easily shift his essence a dozen times within the span of a 
			single Exchange. Should the effigy holding his essence be killed or knocked out, the sorcerer will have ample 
			time to shift his essence to another effigy, provided he is conscious.</p>
			
			<p>In combat, every effigy suffers wounds, Shock, Pain, Blood Loss etc. individually. The sorcerer himself 
			suffers only from the wound effects of the effigy currently housing his essence. After this sorcery has run its 
			course, he retains the wound affecting the final effigy he inhabited at its end, which may be none at all. It 
			does not matter what the other effigies have suffered.</p>
			
			<p>The sorcerer may also work sorcery while split into several effigies, but only with the effigy currently 
			housing his essence. While he invokes sorcery, the other effigies will either remain passive or very closely 
			mirror his words and gestures, in which case the sorcery will manifest in a manner not giving away what effigy 
			has actually worked it.</p>
			
			<p>The sorcerer can dissolve any or all of the effigies at any time. If he does not do so prematurely, they 
			will fade at the end of the scene or after about half an hour, whatever is most appropriate.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_Firestorm">Firestorm</p>
			<p><em>Prerequisites: Cursing & Witchfire</em></p>
			<p>This Arcane Secret imparts knowledge of a ritual of three Limelights’ duration and allows the sorcerer to 
			spread out the effect of his Witchfire Mystery over a vast area, targeting everybody within it. The affected 
			area must somehow be logically delineated, like an army, a fleet, a castle, a village, or a city (which is 
			about the largest area that can be affected). A storm of Witchfire attacks will erupt in this area, targeting 
			people within it at random and lasting for one Limelight (or about 30 seconds) per Success on the Casting Check 
			made with the worse SP of either Cursing or Witchfire.</p>
			
			<p>During this time a base of about 50 people will be hit (not merely attacked) by Witchfire. This number 
			doubles with every additional Casting Success. A Firestorm called down upon an army with 7 Casting Successes 
			would therefore roll over that army for about three to four minutes and strike down roughly 3200 people. 
			Considering the probable raw power of any sorcerer knowing Firestorm, all normal victims of it can be 
			considered killed or very nearly dead.</p>
			
			<p>If special characters like PCs are among the group affected, it should be randomly determined whether they 
			are attacked or not, based upon the actual statistical likelihood of this occurring, though slanted towards an 
			attack occurring. If the character is attacked, the original Casting dice are rolled again against TN 6 for a 
			QoS of the hit, which can be defended against as per the rules for Witchfire. If he is hit, the Impact Rating 
			is QoS + the Casting Successes just rolled.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_HandOfDoom">Hand of Doom</p>
			<p><em>Prerequisites: Goety & Necromancy</em></p>
			<p>This is a dreadful Arcane Secret that can be easily cast almost instantaneously, definitely in a single 
			Limelight.</p>
			
			<p>The sorcerer calls words of power and extends his hand towards a target within no more than 10 meters and 
			invokes certain entities. He then makes a Casting Check with the worse of his Goety or Necromancy, which the 
			victim can resist with TY. If the victim is victorious or ties the sorcerer, he feels merely intense pain, the 
			equivalent of Pain equal to the dice in the sorcerer’s pool for this Arcane Secret; this Pain is halved with 
			every passing Combat Round until it disappears and subsides, but unreduced by TY. If the sorcerer is however 
			victorious by but a single Success, one of the victim’s organs (sorcerer’s choice) will burst out of the 
			victim’s body, ripping through any clothing and armor, and jump into the sorcerer’s outstretched hand.</p>
			
			<p>Alternatively, the sorcerer can decide to rip off a limb, including the head. Depending on the organ, death 
			is either instant or follows within seconds from blood loss and system shock.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_MasterTheBeast">Master the Beast</p>
			<p><em>Prerequisites: Goety & Enslavement</em></p>
			<p>This short ritual, easily completed within a single Limelight, calls local animals into the sorcerer’s 
			presence, enables them to understand his wishes and forces them to his bidding for the duration of the current 
			scene, after which they will disperse again. Animals begin to arrive in the sorcerer’s presence as soon as he 
			finishes the ritual, and continue to arrive in great numbers – greater numbers than could conceivably exist in 
			the sorcerer’s vicinity. It is therefore theorized that this Arcane Secret not only calls animals, but actually 
			also brings them into being.</p>
			
			<p>The type of animals is always one specific, locally existing species, and the species that can be called 
			must always be one that has something sinister to it. Scorpions, snakes, spiders, centipedes, crows, vultures, 
			wolves, hyenas, jackals, bats, cats, and crocodiles are possible, but doves, horses and rabbits are not. In 
			some settings, there may be further limitations as to the species that can be invoked.</p>
			
			<p>The Casting Check is made out of the worse of the sorcerer’s Goety or Enslavement pool, and every Success 
			results in about 150 small animals like scorpions and spiders answering the call, or about 50 mid-sized animals 
			like jackals and vultures, or about 15 large animals like crocodiles.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_MoldTheFlesh">Mold the Flesh</p>
			<p><em>Prerequisites: Goety & Necromancy</em></p>
			<p>This Arcane Secret imparts knowledge of a surprisingly short ritual, easily completed in but a single 
			Limelight that allows the sorcerer to temporarily shift his shape into another creature’s, thereby attaining 
			all this creature’s physical characteristics.</p>
			
			<p>Mechanically, the worse of the sorcerer’s Goety or Necromancy pool is checked, with the changed shape for up 
			to 15 minutes; he can however end the sorcery and shift back at any anterior time. Exactly what animal shape 
			can be assumed will vary from campaign to campaign but as a guideline should be one between one twentieth and 
			five times the sorcerer’s own mass.</p>
			
			<p>Normally, it will have to be a type of animal that has something sinister to it (see Master the Beast), but 
			if the ref waives this requirement he is encouraged to instead limit the power of this Arcane Secret by having 
			it impart only the ability to shift into one specific type of animal and require it to be “rediscovered” for 
			every additional species.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_PlagueWind">Plague Wind</p>
			<p><em>Prerequisites: Necromancy & Mending</em></p>
			<p>This Arcane Secret imparts knowledge of how to conduct a lengthy ritual requiring several hours to complete 
			that will afflict an area with a very deadly plague. The area where the plague first appears must be one with 
			distinct political or geographical boundaries, exactly as with Blight, but it will spread naturally beyond this 
			area.</p>
			
			<p>For every Success on the Casting Check, which is made with the worse of the Mending and Necromancy pool, 
			about 10 % of the people in the boundary at the time of the casting will contract the plague, some immediately, 
			some as much as ten days after the casting. Of those who contract it 50% + 5% per Casting Success will die from 
			it.</p>
			
			<p>Casting Successes also give a gauge of how easy it is for people not originally within the area affected by 
			the Arcane Secret to contract the plague later on: 1 Success would mean that actual ingesting of body fluids is 
			necessary to contract it, while 10 Successes would mean that just being within a few meters of a plague carrier 
			would suffice.</p>
			
			<p>The severity of the plague deteriorates over time. Every week after the casting, the effective number of 
			Casting Successes is reduced by 1. Still, a very successful application of this Arcane Secret might practically 
			depopulate a country.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_Portal">Portal</p>
			<p><em>Prerequisites: Goety & Necromancy</em></p>
			<p>By use of this ritual the sorcerer establishes a link between two locales, no matter how distant, 
			effectively conjoining those locales and allowing things and beings from one to pass through to the other.</p>
			
			<p>Opening a portal to a location the sorcerer is currently seeing or familiar with requires but 1 Casting 
			Success on the Check made with the worse of either Goety or Necromancy SP. A portal to a place he has only 
			visited once or twice requires 2 Successes, and one to a place he has never visited but is well informed about 
			requires 3 Successes.</p>
			
			<p>He cannot open a gateway to any locale he has no knowledge of. The aspects of the portal that may be 
			crafted fall under these broad categories:</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Direction - A portal is usually two-way. Making it one-way uses up 1 Success. This being exactly the 
				other way around may be more appropriate for some settings, though</li>
				
				<li>Access - The portal is by default open to everybody. Limiting it to the sorcerer’s use alone (in any or 
				all directions) uses up 1 Success. Size - By default, the portal admits up to human-sized creatures or 
				things. Widening it to admit large ones uses up 1 Success, and huge ones yet another Success. Expending a 
				third Success makes it large enough to sail a ship through it</li>
				
				<li>Duration - A portal stays open for a single Combat Round. Expending additional Successes extends this to 
				a Limelight, a scene (or about half an hour), a day, a month, a year, a decade, and permanent, in this 
				order</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>The sorcerer must delineate these desired properties before the Check is made, and if necessary successes 
			fall short, the portal does either not open at all or else is unstable, and before failing generates a unique 
			Complication related to some property of the portal, falling on any who still dare to brave it.</p>
			
			<p>The ritual to establish this gateway usually requires about an hour, but in an emergency the sorcerer may 
			rip it open quickly and violently in but a single Combat Round. This requires three times the ordinary number

			<p><em>Prerequisite: Goety</em></p>
			<p>With this ritual’s duration of about an hour or two, the sorcerer creates a violent earthquake. The effect 
			is slightly setting-specific, as its mechanics orient themselves after the sturdiest building technique and 
			materials available in the campaign. For every Success of the Casting Check made with the worse of Goety or 
			Witchfire SP about 5% of the buildings of this top durability are completely destroyed by the earthquake and 
			another 10% heavily damaged. Less sturdy buildings are of course affected to a greater degree.</p>
			
			<p>The area affected at full strength has a diameter of about half a kilometre, with areas farther out being 
			struck by less violent tremors. The epicentre of the full strength is surrounded by concentric rings of about 
			half a kilometre each, with each being affected with a severity of 1 less Success. Alternatively, the sorcerer 
			may forgo to have anything outside the epicenter affected, invoking a blatantly sorcerous, sharply delineated 
			earthquake.</p>

			<p class="h4" id="P_WhisperMyNameInFear">Whisper My Name in Fear</p>
			<p><em>Prerequisite: Prophecy & Scrying</em></p>
			<p>Once a sorcerer learns this Secret, he will know from that moment on whenever his name is spoken anywhere 
			in the world. If somebody utters the sorcerer’s name, the sorcerer immediately and unfailingly learns this 
			person’s name, location, identity (e.g. farmer, nobleman, soldier, etc.), in what context his name was spoken 
			(e.g. hostile, reverential, in awe, plotting, etc.), and also the names and identities of this person’s 
			interlocutors. There is no Check involved. In short, the sorcerer cannot be spoken of anymore without him 
			becoming aware of it.</p>
			
			<p>The one chance to avoid drawing the sorcerer’s attention is not using his name but referring to him 
			obliquely. Speaking about the sorcerer in that way requires an Amazing CG Check for it not to be noticed. If 
			this is additionally done in either hushed tones or a completely enclosed space, the Challenge Level becomes 
			merely Difficult or Challenging if both is the case. This is however far from common knowledge: While it may 
			well be part of common folk lore that uttering a sorcerer’s name is bad luck requiring only a QoS of 1 on an 
			Occultism Check to have heard of, knowing about the effectiveness of whispering would be a Difficult Occultism 
			Check, and about that of enclosed spaces an Amazing one.</p>
			
			<p>Gaining the knowledge of being spoken about does not divert the sorcerer’s attention or disrupt his 
			concentration in any way. Even if a thousand people were to speak about him at the same time this would not 
			disrupt the sorcerer’s present doings in any way; he just knows, without the knowledge drawing his attention 
			away from anything else.</p>
