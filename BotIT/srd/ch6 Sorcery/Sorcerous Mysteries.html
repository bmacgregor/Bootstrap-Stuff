			<p class="h4">The Lesser Mysteries</p>
			<p>The six lesser Mysteries are:</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Cursing</li>
				<li>Enslavement</li>
				<li>Mending</li>
				<li>Prophecy</li>
				<li>Scrying</li>
				<li>Witchfire</li>

			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_LSR_Cursing">Cursing</p>
			<p>Cursing is the dark art of placing a doom on somebody. Curses are best placed on somebody in the sorcerer’s 
			immediate presence, but if the victim of the curse is not present, the sorcerer must at least know the victim 
			and have either a close personal possession (a piece of well-worn clothing or other item to which the victim is 
			emotionally attached), or a body part or secretion (hair, saliva, fingernails, etc.) of the victim at hand.</p>
			
			<p>In this case, a small ritual of about five minutes is necessary to place the curse. However, if the victim 
			is in the sorcerer’s immediate presence – no more than a stone’s throw – the curse can be placed much more 
			quickly, in but a single combat round, simply by uttering the curse formula, aloud and dramatically pointing 
			out the victim.</p>
			
			<p>To curse somebody, the sorcerer makes his Casting Check as an Opposed Check against the victim’s TY. A 
			targeted sorcerer (A to C Sorcery Priority) may opt instead to use his Power instead of TY to oppose this 
			Mystery, and should he also know the Cursing Mystery himself, receives bonus dice equal to half again his 
			Power (though no more than his rating in the Cursing Mystery) to add to his choice of TY or Power for the 
			Opposed Check. If the victim equals or surpasses the sorcerer’s Casting Successes, the curse does not take 
			effect, but if the sorcerer is victorious his curse takes hold.</p>
			
			<p>The sorcerer’s total Successes, not just those surpassing the victim’s Successes, translate directly into a 
			curse rating, which works much like a Passion Attribute. Whenever the cursed character is making a Check to 
			avoid <strong>dire consequences</strong>, the curse’s rating is either subtracted from the number of dice he 
			is entitled to roll, or is added to the dice pool of whoever is opposing him (but not both in the same 
			instance).</p>
			
			<p>Each time the curse rating causes something bad to happen to the cursed character, the rating drops by 2, 
			until it is finally reduced to 0, at which time the curse will have run its course. Barring that, the only 
			other way to get rid of the curse is to have it lifted.</p>
			
			<p>A sorcerer can also curse a victim with a specific doom. In this case, the curse rating is not equal to the 
			Casting Successes; if the specific doom is merely unpleasant, the curse rating is 1 point less than the number 
			of Casting Successes; if it is something very serious that would be hard to put right again, the curse rating 
			is 2 points less; and if it is something deadly or utterly ruinous the curse rating is 3 points less. Should 
			the resulting curse rating drop below 1, the curse fails to take hold.</p>
			
			<p>The curse rating of this type in any case works very similar to a curse of mere bad fortune, but instead of 
			applying to all Checks to avoid something bad happening, it is subtracted either from all the cursed 
			character’s dice pools to avoid the specific doom, or added to all dice pools of people working to bring the 
			doom about (again, not both in the same instance).</p>
			
			<p>This type of curse lasts until lifted or until the doom has come to pass. Lifting a curse requires a Mending 
			spell to be cast upon the cursed character that achieves more Successes than the original Casting Successes 
			(which can be different from the curse rating).</p>
			
			<p>Alternatively, if the cursed character has a faith-related PA he can, at a suitable locale, make an offering 
			to his deity and ask for remittance of the curse. To do so, the character Checks the relevant PA against TN 7. 
			If he achieves Successes at least equal to the curse rating, the rating is reduced to 0 and the curse lifted, 
			fewer Successes have no effect at all. This is all-or-nothing, and it can only be attempted once per 
			curse.</p>
			
			<p><em>Optional: A dying curse is a mainstay of sorcerers everywhere. Such a curse will be powerful in any 
			case, as the sorcerer need not worry anymore with Containment, but if this rule is in effect, it can be made 
			more powerful still: A dying curse can always be uttered, no matter how instant the manner of the sorcerer’s 
			death, and is made with a –2 Casting bonus to TN.</em></p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_LSR_Enslavement">Enslavement</p>
			<p>With the Mystery of Enslavement, the sorcerer forces his will on his victims’ will, right up to the point 
			where the sorcerer commands his victim’s view of reality. It is in essence a kind of very high-powered 
			hypnosis. This Mystery requires neither formulas nor gestures, just that the sorcerer makes eye contact with 
			his victim.</p>
			
			<p>The sorcerer <strong>first</strong> makes his Casting Check, which the victim can oppose with the better of 
			his TY or SY. A sorcerous victim (A to C Sorcery Priority) may opt to use his Power instead of TY or SY to 
			oppose the Mystery, and should he also know the Enslavement Mystery himself, he gets additional bonus dice 
			equal to half again his Power (though no more than his rating in the Enslavement Mystery) to his choice of TY, 
			SY, or Power. If the sorcerer is victorious, the victim begins gazing into the sorcerer’s eyes, forgetting 
			everything else, largely motionless and completely oblivious to everything around him.</p>

			<p>As long as the sorcerer maintains unbroken eye contact, the victim cannot snap out of his magical trance and 
			would be unable to take action even if his life was in serious danger; he is like the rabbit before the snake. 
			Any sharp pain will however tear the victim out of the trance – a slap in the face is insufficient for this, a 
			hard punch to the stomach suffices.</p>
			
			<p>Apart from filching a held character’s pockets or just slitting his throat, a sorcerer can use Enslavement 
			to achieve one of two effects on the victim:</p>
			
			<ol>
				<li><p>A sorcerer can command his victim to do something – anything, really. The sorcerer tells the 
				victim – in a language the victim can understand – what to do and makes another Casting Check, again 
				Opposed with the better of the victim’s SY or TY. For the attacking sorcerer, while this second Opposed 
				Check must be made with the same base number of dice as the original, additional bonus dice equaling his 
				QoS from the first Check are added, and does not necessitate a new Containment Check. Sorcerous targets of 
				the Mystery at this stage don’t gain any benefits from their own knowledge of the occult in resisting the 
				Enslavement, as their supernatural defences have already been invaded by the previous Opposed Check.</p>
				
				<p>If the victim at least ties the sorcerer, he immediately snaps out of the ensorcelment and is once again 
				his own master. If the sorcerer is victorious, the victim will carry out the command, no matter what. If 
				the command is more than one single, concrete action, like disembowelling oneself or jumping down a cliff 
				or striking at somebody, its fulfilment can take no longer than about one minute per Casting Success of 
				the sorcerer (the total Successes, not just the surpassing ones).</p>
				
				<p>Such a command must be a simple action, a single, concrete thing; it can encompass walking to the locale 
				where the mission can be fulfilled, but it can include neither sub-clauses nor follow-ups. During the 
				pursuit of this mission, the enslaved character will move like in a trance, unable to react to persons and 
				events outside of his command’s scope; he won’t be even conscious of them. Once the command is carried out, 
				the ensorcelled person will stand inactive for the remainder of the Enslavement’s duration, after which he 
				will regain his senses and a hazy memory of what has transpired.</p></li>
				
				<li><p>In the victim’s mind, one thing in his vicinity appears as something completely different. The 
				sorcerer must tell the enslaved person what the thing “really” is (“What a fool you are, to wear a reptile 
				about your waist!”), and the victim will react as if the object actually were what he is told it is, 
				providing any movement or action of the hallucination from his own imagination. </p>
				
				<p>The limit to this suggestive power is that any object can only appear as something of similar shape and 
				size – sword to snake, horse to tiger, man to other man, cup to tarantula, etc. To thus befuddle somebody, 
				the sorcerer makes a second Casting Check, again Opposed by the better of the victim’s SY or TY.</p>
				
				<p>The base number of Casting dice must be the same as in the original Casting Check, but with the 
				addition of bonus dice equaling QoS from the initial Check added to the second, and no need for a 
				Containment Check. And again, sorcerous targets receive no special benefits resisting.</p>
				
				<p>If the victim at least ties the sorcerer, he will immediately snap out of the hypnotic trance and again 
				be his own master. If the sorcerer is victorious, the affected character sees the object as what he is 
				told it is and will act accordingly – as will the hallucination, fuelled by the character’s imagination 
				and expectations. If anything hallucinatory happens that would cause the death of the victim, e.g. a 
				bite by a poisonous animal or having the throat torn out by a predator, the victim passes out and must 
				pass a TY Check of Average difficulty to avoid actually dying from the shock.</p>
				
				<p>If nothing of the kind happens, the befuddled state lasts for as many Limelights as the sorcerer had 
				Successes on the Casting Check (the total Successes, not just the surpassing ones), after which time the 
				victim will regain his senses.</p></li>
			<ol>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_LSR_Mending">Mending</p>
			<p>The Mending Mystery can be used to aid in and greatly speed up the recovery from injuries, though it does 
			not normally heal them immediately. The Casting Check is made Unopposed, and the resulting number of Successes 
			is divided into two equal halves.</p>
			
			<p>The first (and smaller, if applicable) half is the combined Pain rating that is deducted from all the target 
			character’s current wounds. These deductions must be spread among the injuries as evenly as possible. If for 
			instance 3 Pain is deducted from a character’s three wounds, 1 Pain would be subtracted from every wound, if 
			from his two wounds, 1 Pain would be subtracted from one and 2 Pain from the other.</p>
			
			<p>The other (and larger, if applicable) half of the Casting Successes speeds up subsequent wound recovery. 
			Under normal circumstances, healing Checks are made every seven days; but if a character has been treated with 
			the Mending Mystery, this interval is halved once for each one of the second half of the Casting Successes.</p>
			
			<p>If for example 6 total Casting Successes are achieved, putting 3 into the second half of the Successes, 
			healing Checks are then made every day (first Success halves interval from 7 to 4 days, second Success halves 
			interval from 4 to 2 days, third Success halves interval from 2 to 1 day).</p>
			
			<p>A character cannot benefit again from the Mending Mystery until all such magically treated wounds have 
			fully healed. New injuries sustained during this time can only be treated with Mending once all previously 
			majicked wounds have healed. Healing Checks for these are made at the normal interval of every seven days.</p>
			
			<p>Mending can also be used to lift a curse (from the Lesser Mystery of this name) from a character. More 
			Casting Successes than were achieved to with Cursing Mystery are necessary to break the curse. The Mending 
			Mystery will also aid and speed up recovery from diseases to a comparable degree than from wounds, but as 
			Sword & Sorcery tales do not concern themselves with things as mundane as diseases, no mechanics are provided. 
			Should this aspect of the Mystery be needed for flavour, the effects should be estimated in analogy to its 
			effect on injuries.</p>
			
			<p>The Mystery can also be used maliciously, to inflict pain upon somebody. This can be done to a victim who 
			is either present, or a distant victim of whom the sorcerer owns either a close personal possession (well-worn 
			clothing, item to which the victim is emotionally attached, etc.) or a body part or secretion (hair, nail 
			clippings, blood, etc.). In the latter case, a small ritual of five to ten minute is necessary, whereas the 
			sorcery can in the former case be worked much quicker, merely by dramatically pointing out the victim and 
			intoning a formula aloud.</p>
			
			<p>The sorcerer’s Casting Check is resisted by the victim’s TY. Targeted sorcerers (A to C Sorcery Priority) 
			may opt to use their Power instead of TY to oppose; should they also know the Mending Mystery themselves, they 
			receive additional bonus dice equal to half again their Power (though no more than their rating in the Mending 
			Mystery) to their choice of TY or Power. If the sorcerer achieves more Successes than his victim, the victim 
			immediately feels intense stabs of pain, corresponding to a Pain rating equal to three times the sorcerer’s 
			total (not just surpassing) Casting Successes.</p>
			
			<p>This Pain, from which TY is subtracted as usual, persists for as long as the sorcerer focuses his attention 
			upon the victim, and indeed increases by 3 with every subsequent Limelight. Should the sorcerer be distracted 
			from the victim or chooses to end the effect, Pain drains away at a rate of 3 points every Limelight. Sorcerers 
			proficient in the Mending Mystery have to decide whether they want to devote themselves to its beneficent or 
			malicious use.</p>
			
			<p>The aspect that they opt for as their main use of the Mystery has the usual Casting and Containment TNs, 
			the opposite use Checks against a +2 TN penalty for both Casting and Containment.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_LSR_Prophecy">Prophecy</p>
			<p>Prophecy is the art of either seeing into the future or else divining something that is not readily 
			apparent. The kind of questions that can be answered by Prophecy fall into two categories, the broader “Will 
			I succeed?” or “Should I go ahead?” type of questions, and the much more specific “Who is?” or “Where is?” 
			type.</p>
			
			<p>To answer either, the sorcerer needs to utilize a Prophecy ritual specific to the setting and his own 
			preferences: It might be prophetic dreams, stargazing, the casting of bones, questioning the tarot, reading 
			entrails of sacrificial animals, and much more. For the broad type of question, the player first states whether 
			he’d rather like a negative or positive answer to the question and then makes his Casting Check. If the answer 
			is obvious to the referee, he simply decides upon “yes” or “no”, but if it isn’t, he rolls a d12, subtracting 
			one third the sorcerer’s Casting Successes if the player wished for a positive answer or adding this number 
			if the player wished for a negative one. A result of 1-5 yields a “yes”, 6-7 is indifferent, and 8-12 is “no”. 
			But however the answer was determined, it translates into an Omen rating of 1, which functions like a Passion 
			Attribute.</p>
			
			<p>The Omen rating is added to all Checks to bring about a result in accordance with the answer and subtracted 
			from all Checks to bring about a result contrary to the answer. The more specific type of question after 
			things like something’s or somebody’s location or identity is not as easily cast into rules. A correct answer 
			will require any number of Successes deemed appropriate by the referee, with 1 sufficient only for such 
			trivial questions like the location of a misplaced item, while divining the identity of an unseen mastermind 
			behind some hardly grasped intrigue would for instance require at least 6 Successes, possibly more.</p>
			
			<p>If insufficient Successes are achieved, the Prophecy is inconclusive, but if the Casting Check is a Botch, the 
			resultant Complication is an answer that is either dangerously ambiguous or outright maliciously misleading.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_LSR_Scrying">Scrying</p>
			<p>The Mystery of Scrying is the practice of sending one’s consciousness, or maybe one’s spirit, astral body, 
			or soul, away from one’s physical self and having it travel quickly to distant places to spy out what is 
			happening there. To do so, the sorcerer enters a deep trance, usually one aided by certain drugs. Depending 
			on the specifics of the setting, certain paraphernalia, like mirrors or crystals to gaze into, might also be 
			necessary.</p>
			
			<p>While his body is resting senseless, his consciousness rises out of it, able to pass unseen and unfelt 
			through all matter and to travel at vast speeds. This immaterial embodiment, maybe an astral body or maybe 
			the soul, of the sorcerer is unable to affect the physical world, but it may observe and listen in on what 
			is taking place in it. Once the sorcerer’s magical trance is sufficiently deep, which may take anywhere from 
			ten minutes to over an hour, he makes a Casting Check.</p>
			
			<p>For every Success, he can, depending on the setting or the sorcerous tradition employed, either stay out of 
			his body for five minutes while traveling at about 600 km an hour, or for half an hour while travelling at 200 
			km an hour. The more Successes he achieves, the longer his consciousness can stay away from his body, and the 
			more distant the places his consciousness may visit. At the end of this timespan, the consciousness will snap 
			back into the physical self and the sorcerer will awaken, usually disoriented, fatigued or hung over.</p>
			
			<p>He can elect to have his consciousness return before the maximum time is up, but he is entirely unconscious 
			of what is happening around and to his body while his sorcerous vision is travelling to distant places. Wounds, 
			danger or discomfort will come to his attention only when he comes out of his magical trance. Should his body 
			die while it is in trance, so does the embodiment of his consciousness, and the soul then goes to whatever 
			place souls go after death.</p>
			
			<p>The presence of a scrying consciousness cannot be noticed by humans, save those with the Detect Sorcery 
			Skill, who can make a Check to sense a presence, and to other sorcerers who know the Mystery of Scrying and 
			who will detect the presence of a scryer’s sorcerous vision on even a single Success on an Unopposed SY Check, 
			and even clearly see such a presence as a kind of astral body on two Successes on this Check.</p>
			
			<p>Disembodied spirits can detect a sorcerer’s disembodied consciousness automatically, as can many 
			supernatural beings like demons or ghosts. Many such beings may even be able to interact with the spiritual 
			body and possibly even harm it as if it were physical. Should the astral body be killed by such an attack, 
			the sorcerer’s physical body dies as well.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_LSR_Witchfire">Witchfire</p>
			<p>The Witchfire Mystery sorcerously unleashes energies to damage or outright destroy inanimate and animate 
			things. Despite the Mystery’s name, those energies need not manifest as fire, but can take any number of 
			forms, depending on both the setting and the sorcerous tradition employed. It can be beams of searing light 
			from the sorcerer’s eyes, bolts of fire leaping from his fingertips, a spectral vortex of slavering demonic 
			shapes, lightning or pillars of fire from the sky, a dagger appearing in the sorcerer’s hands and launched by 
			him, and a thousand more things. It can even be innocuous and take the form of a handy object striking the 
			target, like masonry collapsing on it or a horse kicking it.</p>

			<p>In game terms, Witchfire manifests as a ranged weapon of the launched type (see Table 27), without the 
			capability to attack at Extreme Range and with an Archery Pool cost for every +/– 1 on table 4.5, taken from 
			one Range band worse than the actual attack (i.e. Near to Extreme); Witchfire is notoriously hard to aim 
			precisely.</p>
			
			<p>The sorcerer utilizing Witchfire makes Casting and Containment Checks as normal. Any Casting Successes 
			double as both the Witchfire’s eventual Damage Rating, and as Proficiency dice for the Archery Pool, which is 
			Aim + Successes.</p>
			
			<p>Defense against Witchfire is possible by Blocking and Evasion, exactly as against launched missiles like 
			arrows and bolts. However, to be able to defend against it, the target must realize in time what is coming his 
			way. Most targets will thus need to pass a Surprise Check of Challenge Level 4 even if they are watching the 
			sorcerer intently.</p>
			
			<p>Any previous experience with Witchfire will make this Check one degree easier, as will previous experience 
			with Witchfire from the same sorcerer, and already having been attacked by Witchfire in the same Scene, for a 
			minimum Challenge Level of 1 if all three apply (as per Table 4.0). A successful Precognition Skill Check 
			does away with the need for a Surprise Check, as does any degree of the Occultism Skill, unless the target is 
			in a situation where he would have to Check for Surprise even for a mundane attack. If the Witchfire strike 
			is successful, hit location is determined as with any other missile weapon, i.e. by rolling on Table 4.5 and 
			then the on the table for the corresponding Target Zone.</p>
			
			<p>The hit’s Impact Rating is calculated by adding the original Casting Successes to the QoS of the attack 
			Roll (QoS + Casting Successes). Both BN and Armor Value protect against Witchfire as normal. The Damage Table 
			and Armor Values used are the ones most closely corresponding to the manifestation of Witchfire, or Cleaving 
			if none seems to fit outright.</p>
			
			<p>The eldritch nature of sorcerers offers them additional protection against Witchfire. Any sorcerous 
			character (A through C Sorcery Priority) can use half his Power Attribute as additional Armor Value against 
			Witchfire strikes, or their full Power if they know the Witchfire Mystery themselves.</p>
			
			<p>Characters built with the E or F Sorcery Priorities are particularly vulnerable against Witchfire and may 
			not use their BN ratings in soaking up damage from it.</p>

			<p class="h4" id="P_GRT_Overview">Greater Mystery Overview</p>
			<p>The two Greater Mysteries are:</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Goety</li>
				<li>Necromancy</li>
			</ul>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_GRT_Goety">Goety</p>
			<p>One of the two greater Mysteries, this is the sorcery of conjuration, command, and banishment of 
			supernatural creatures from beyond the boundaries of the world, those commonly called demons. From where these 
			creatures originate is specific to the setting – they may be from out of the dark between the stars, from other 
			dimensions, from alien planets light years away, or some other unfathomably strange place. The attitude of 
			these demons towards humanity and the sorcerer also varies with the setting – it may be anything from annoyed 
			irritation to haughty expectations of worship to all-consuming hatred.</p>
			
			<p>Whatever it is, it is never friendly. The Occultism Skill provides knowledge on the outlook of demons, or at 
			least what their outlook is perceived to be. What general type ritual the conjuration of such a demon requires 
			will depend again on the flavor of the setting.</p>
			
			<p>The three necessary components of conjuration in all settings are purification of the sorcerer (which might 
			take anywhere from under an hour to over a day, depending on the setting), a ritual taking from under ten 
			minutes to over an hour, and a blood sacrifice. The minimum sacrifice that is acceptable again depends on the 
			setting and might for example be a large mammal, a human being, or a virgin.</p>
			
			<p>To conjure the demon, the sorcerer makes his Casting Check. His SP pool for this Casting Check is modified 
			by the result of a Difficult Occultism Check; every Success the Occultism Check is short of the required 3 
			penalizes the SP pool by –1, while every Success over 3 adds +1 to it. The second modifier is the extent of the 
			sacrifice.</p>
			
			<p>The minimum sacrifice required adds nothing, but every ‘step up’ from this base (mammal to man and man to 
			virgin) adds +1 die, as does every time the minimum is multiplied by 10. If the minimum acceptable sacrifice 
			is for example a human being and the sorcerer offers up 10 virgins he receives +2 to his SP. For the practiced 
			sorcerer, piercing the divides to the realms where demons dwell isn’t difficult, but finding the one demon he 
			wants to conjure may well be, and the search for the right one takes time, during which the sorcerer’s 
			consciousness is in close contact with a very alien realm, exposing him to massive degrees of Taint. To 
			successfully conjure a demon into his presence, the sorcerer needs to achieve but 1 Success on his Casting 
			Check. However, for the summoned demon to be exactly the right one, 5 Casting Successes are necessary.</p>
			
			<p>If the wrong demon is called forth, its exact type depends on the ref’s approach to demons. Some refs might 
			enjoy statting out long catalogues of demons, from which the sorcerer may choose one to conjure; if that is 
			the case, the ref chooses another demon from the catalogue, its difference in stats and powers to the desired 
			one being 1 point less or greater per each Casting Success short of 5. Other refs may allow players to stat 
			out their own demons; in that case, the ref changes the Attribute total of the arriving demon by 2 points per 
			Casting Success short of 5, or adds or subtracts one special power per Casting Success short of it. Please 
			note that all the changes should either make the demon more or less powerful – which one should be determined 
			randomly. Whatever the approach, the sorcerer has to state what demon he wants to conjure before the dice are 
			resorted to, either by choosing one from a list or by statting it out.</p>
			
			<p>Should the sorcerer achieve more than 5 Casting Successes, the extra Successes carry over as bonus dice to 
			his SP for the next stage of the summoning, the Coercion Check. This Check represents the sorcerer bargaining 
			with the demon, or intimidating it into compliance and is a second Casting Check, with a SP already impacted 
			by any Taint the sorcerer may have picked up during the summoning itself. The demon Opposes this Casting Check 
			with his worst Attribute, with +1 die added for every special power it possesses.</p>
			
			<p>Tying this Opposed Check yields an inconclusive outcome, with the demon departing or being pulled back to 
			whence it came. If the demon is victorious, it is unshackled from the sorcerous constraints that held it 
			during the Coercion Check and is free to either attack the summoner, depart, or stray into the world to cause 
			havoc. How long such an unbound demon may roam the world depends on the setting – it might be a day or a year 
			per initial Casting Success, or possibly for as long as the sorcerer lives, or anything else. Should the 
			demon choose to attack the sorcerer and manage to incapacitate him (immobilize him through grappling, knock 
			him out, reduce his pools to 0 through Pain, etc.), he may and probably will carry him off to its place of 
			origin, never to be heard of again.</p>
			
			<p>For the remainder of the scene in which the sorcerer failed his Opposed Coercion Check against the demon, 
			he is at +1 TN in all actions directed against this demon. In addition, and cumulative with that +1 TN, he is 
			+2 TN to use Goety against this demon for as long as it remains free in the world. If the sorcerer is 
			victorious in the Coercion Check, he may demand a number of tasks from the demon equal to his QoS. A task is 
			defined as a simple, straightforward service, for instance attempting to kill a single person. If 
			fulfillment of this task requires travel over a greater distance than a few hundred meters, this counts as a 
			separate task, as does returning to the sorcerer (should the sorcerer demand this). If the place where the 
			demon is to travel to is ill defined or entirely undefined, for instance when slaying a person whose current 
			exact location is unknown to the sorcerer, determining the locale also counts as a separate task.</p>
			
			<p>Similarly, if a task can only be accomplished in stages, each stage also counts as a task of its own. 
			Finally, if a task requires more than an hour of the demon’s time, every doubling of this initial span of time 
			also counts as a task all of its own. The exception to this is when the task is to merely guard a stationary 
			person or item, or a locale; in this case, with no travelling required of the demon, the initial span of time 
			for the task is a day, not an hour.</p>
			
			<p>Please note that demons travel virtually instantaneously as long as they are not carrying living beings; if 
			they are to take along a living being their travel times are determined by their mode and speed of 
			locomotion.</p>
			
			<p>Examples:</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>“Fetch me the sceptre of King Yezdigerd.” – 4 tasks (1 base + 1 travel to location + 1 location 
				ill-defined + 1 return to sorcerer)</li>
				<li>“Kill Conan.” – 3 tasks (1 base + 1 travel to location + 1 location undefined)</li>
				<li>“Carry me to the top of Mount Yimsha.” – 2 tasks (1 base + 1 time), assuming a travel time of over 
				one but no more than two hours</li>
				<li>“Fetch me the Heart of Ahriman from the vaults of the temple of Mitra.” – 6 tasks (1 base + 1 travel 
				to location + 1 location ill-defined + 1 overcoming magical wards + 1 defeating guardian of the Heart + 1 
				return to sorcerer), and a hefty chance of failing with ward and guardian</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>If the scope of such service is clear at the moment of the Coercion attempt, any shortage of the required 
			number of Successes results in the demon declaring that the sorcerer is asking too much and returning from 
			whence it came, but if the scope is variable, as in killing an unspecified number of persons or guarding 
			something for as long as possible, the demon will, provided that the sorcerer was successful at all, at least 
			begin the task, but will abandon it as soon as the sorcerer’s Successes are ‘spent.’ Sometimes, a sorcerer 
			will want to banish a demon. This is relatively straightforward in the case of a demon he himself conjured, 
			as he is already familiar with the demon and its attributes, but it is more difficult if the demon was 
			conjured by somebody else. In this latter case, the sorcerer must make an Occultism Check at Legendary 
			difficulty; and for every Success short of 5, his sorcery pool to banish the demon is penalized by 1.</p>
			
			<p>The banishing ritual itself takes anywhere from half a minute to several minutes, and again is 
			setting-specific. Once the ritual has been begun, the demon cannot leave the immediate surroundings of the 
			sorcerer, but must remain both within earshot and sight. He may not attack the sorcerer, who is protected by 
			the ritual he has invoked, but is otherwise free to do as he pleases, including trying to kill the sorcerer’s 
			companions and causing havoc to distract the sorcerer or even harm him indirectly, for example by setting 
			ablaze the sorcerer’s immediate surroundings.</p>
			
			<p>The sorcerer’s Casting Check is opposed by the demon’s worst Attribute, with +1 die bonus per special power 
			it possesses. To banish a demon successfully, the sorcerer has to emerge victorious from the contest; a tie 
			or a defeat for the sorcerer allows the demon to remain. If a sorcerer does successfully banish a demon he 
			did not himself conjure in the first place, he accrues only one third the normal Taint (after the Containment 
			Check is made), unless the Containment Check results in a Taint discharge, in which case he accumulates the 
			ordinary amount of Taint.</p>
			
			<p>A few quick guidelines to the power of demons: Demons never have HT scores, not even the succubus-like ones. 
			CG is used instead, where necessary. Demons should not have Attribute scores much higher than 12, and their 
			lowest Attribute should not normally be less than a quarter of their highest. Their Proficiency scores in all 
			their modes of attack should be identical to Reflex, or very close to it, or to Aim in case of ranged attacks. 
			Their Damage Rating with special forms of attack like fire breathing should be very close to the Damage Rating 
			of more mundane forms of attack like bites. If the demon knows any Mysteries (which would have to be purchased 
			as a special power), its rating in it should be identical, or very close to, its TY.</p>
			
			<p>Demons may have additional traits that are in line with their physical appearance – a winged demon should 
			for example be able to fly, or a very shaggy demon have some kind of Armor Value. Only traits that are not 
			reflected by their appearance or that go clearly beyond anything a mundane animal might exhibit should be 
			regarded as ‘special powers’ in the sense referred to repeatedly above. This includes special forms of attack 
			like hypnosis or acid spitting, any armor beyond Armor Value 2 or not reflected by the demon’s appearance, 
			useful special abilities like fast regeneration or ultramundane modes of movement like shifting through walls, 
			and anything else along these lines.</p>
			
			<p>Special powers to some degree also include bulk, and the accompanying reduction of damage, as for large and 
			huge animals. A demon should receive one of these traits for free only if he is very clearly bulky enough for 
			it – the trait ‘large’ should for example only be applied for free if the demon is of a bulk where one would 
			otherwise already consider assigning the trait ‘huge’; otherwise, the trait needs to be purchased as a special 
			power. If a demon who would not even receive the trait ‘large’ for free is to be ‘huge’, this counts as two 
			special powers.</p>
			
			<p>Size and bulk also extend to the special trait of some large creatures to fully engage several opponents at 
			the same time, acting on their respective Limelights. Being able to engage a second opponent should only be 
			assigned for free if the demon is both huge and of a bodily configuration to suggest this; otherwise, it has 
			to be purchased as a special power, as do the ability to engage every single further opponent.</p>
			
			<p>Both players and ref should realize that Goety is very powerful and versatile, and that every summoning 
			requires two Casting Checks (Conjuration and Coercion) and thus two Checks to contain Taint. Trafficking with 
			entities from beyond the human domain is a sure way to amass Taint quickly.</p>

			<p class="h4" id="P_GRT_Necromancy">Necromancy</p>
			<p>Necromancy deals with calling up the dead from the beyond, but not to revive them as undead – even though 
			the art of Necromancy can also open the door to this unholy pursuit – but rather to question the shades of the 
			deceased and thereby learn secrets beyond human ken. Where Goety allows the sorcerer to exert power in the 
			world, Necromancy enables him to learn things about the world. At the core of necromancy is the calling up 
			the spirit of a particular deceased person. How exactly this spirit manifests itself, whether as a traditional 
			ghost, or a disembodied voice from the grave, or maybe a vision in a mirror, is specific to the setting, but 
			in any case, the spirit thus summoned is unable to affect the physical world, save perhaps with a Complication 
			on its Containment Check.</p>
			
			<p>To summon a spirit from the underworld, the sorcerer must at least know the deceased’s name; if the name is 
			unknown, it cannot be summoned at all. The SP for the Necromancy Mystery is modified as follows:</p>
			
			<p>In addition to knowing the name, at least one of the following three things must also apply for the 
			summoning to be possible at all. If two of them apply, the sorcerer receives +1 to his SP, and +2 if all three 
			apply:</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>+spec. if the sorcerer is in the presence of the person’s mortal remains</li>
				<li>+spec. if the sorcerer has one or more items at hand that were of great personal importance to the 
				person while alive </li>
				<li>+ spec. if the sorcerer is in the place where the person died Further SP modifiers:
					<ul>
						<li>+1 if the sorcerer knew the person in life</li>
						<li>+1 if the sorcerer knows extensive and correct biographic details of the person (equivalent of 
						at least twenty pages of writing)</li>
						<li>+1 if the sorcerer is a direct descendant of the person</li>
						<li>-1 if the person has been dead for longer than a month </li>
						<li>-1 if the person has been dead for longer than a year (cumulative with above)</li>
						<li>-1 if the person has been dead for longer than 10 years (cumulative with above)</li>
						<li>-1 if the person has been dead for longer than 100 years (cumulative with above)</li>
						<li>-1 if the person has been dead for longer than 1000 years (cumulative with above)</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>The sorcerer makes his Casting Check, which is opposed by the spirit’s TY modified cumulatively as 
			follows:</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>+1 : spirit was a powerful person (sorcerer, nobleman, wealthy merchant, ranking priest)</li>
				<li>+1 : spirit was an independent ruler or head of a cult</li>
				<li>+1 : spirit knew one or more Lesser sorcerous Mysteries</li>
				<li>+1 : spirit knew one or two Greater sorcerous Mysteries</li>
				<li>+1 : spirit knew Necromancy (cumulative with above; sorcerers knowing just Goety get +1, those knowing 
				Necromancy or both Necromancy and Goety gain +2)</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>If the spirit is victorious or ties the sorcerer, the spirit does not appear and the sorcerer cannot attempt 
			to summon this spirit again for a number of months equal to the spirit’s total number of Successes (not just 
			the surpassing ones), unless he achieves a change in summoning circumstances in his favour, ex. attains better 
			summoning modifiers than his last attempt.</p>
			
			<p>If the sorcerer is victorious, the spirit must answer one question per Success of the sorcerer (total 
			Successes, not just surpassing ones) to his best ability. Asking a question the spirit cannot answer uses up 
			one of the sorcerer’s questions.</p>
			
			<p>Spirits know first and foremost details from their own life, but they seem to also learn from other spirits 
			and therefore know much about things that have come to pass after their death, but know nothing that is only 
			known to persons still alive. They also seem to keep track less of more recent events than earlier ones, or 
			maybe they have had too little time to learn about more recent events. To see whether a spirit knows the answer 
			to any given question, the spirit’s TY (not SY) is checked, with the following numbers of Successes 
			required:</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>0 if it pertains to something from the spirit’s own life</li>
				<li>+1 if it pertains to something from the spirit’s walk of life that has happened in the geographical 
				area of the spirit’s life</li>
				<li>+2 if it pertains to either something from the spirit’s walk of life that has happened outside his 
				geographical area of life, or to something outside the spirit’s walk of life that has happened in his 
				geographical area of life</li>
				<li>+3 if it pertains to something both outside the spirit’s walk of life and outside his geographical area 
				of life</li>
				<li>+1 if it pertains to something that has happened either closer to the present time than the spirit’s 
				time of death (e.g. within the last 10 years if the spirit died 20 years ago) or that has happened a longer 
				time before his birth than he is dead (e.g. more than 20 years before his birth if the spirit died 20 years 
				ago). This is cumulative with all modifiers above</li>
				<li>+1 if it pertains to something that has happened either within the recent 10% of time since the spirit’s 
				time of death (e.g. within the last 2 years if the spirit died 20 years ago) or that has happened more than 
				five times as long as he is dead before the time of his birth (e.g. more than 100 years before his birth if 
				the spirit died 20 years ago). This is cumulative with all modifiers above</li>
				<li>+1 if it pertains to something that has happened either within the recent 1% of time since the spirit’s 
				time of death (e.g. within the last 0.2 years if the spirit died 20 years ago) or that has happened more 
				than twenty times as long as he is dead before the time of his birth (e.g. more than 400 years before his 
				birth if the spirit died 20 years ago). This is cumulative with all modifiers above</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>Spirits will not or cannot answer questions pertaining to the afterlife itself, including questions as to 
			whether they are well or unwell in the afterlife or if they are acquainted to a certain person’s spirit. Any 
			such question is a wasted one. Spirits can only report about things that were known to a person – any person, 
			really – in life, provided this person is by now dead. If something is only known to living persons, no spirit 
			can know it.</p>
