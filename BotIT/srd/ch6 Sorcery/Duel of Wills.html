			<p class="h2">The Duel of Wills</p>
			<p>When two sorcerers battle, they don’t usually slug it out Mystery against Mystery (though they may of 
			course), but engage in a Duel of Will instead. The Duel of Wills matches SP against SP in a way similar to how 
			melee combat matches MP against MP, and it has a similar structure of Exchanges and Rounds.</p>
			
			<p>First of all, a Duel of Wills requires two willing participants. It is not possible for one sorcerer to 
			engage another in it against his will; thus, there is also no possibility of surprise. Each sorcerer uses an 
			SP of his choice (usually his best) and announces this choice. There is no need for the SPs to derive from the 
			same Mystery, and no need to stick to the same Mystery every Round. Penalties from Taint and other sources 
			fully apply to the SPs during the Duel of Wills.</p>

			<p class="h4">Duel of Wills Overview</p>
			<p>One sorcerer is determined as initial aggressor and one as defender. In some cases, these roles might be 
			obvious from the circumstances under which the Duel is entered, in other the participants might be in agreement 
			about who is the initial aggressor. If neither is the case, the roles are assigned as desired by the sorcerer 
			built with the better Sorcery Priority, or the higher SP if that is a tie, or the higher Power Attribute if 
			this is a tie as well, or the higher Occultism Skill if tied again.</p>
			
			<p>The aggressor then announces a sorcerous Offensive Maneuver and a number of dice from his SP assigned to it, 
			to which the defender reacts by declaring a sorcerous Defensive Maneuver and also assigns dice. Both then pay 
			any necessary Activation Costs for the chosen Maneuver from their SP, roll their assigned Maneuvers against 
			their normal Casting TN for the Mystery used (6 to 8), applying any modifiers from the Maneuver chosen, in an 
			Opposed Check.</p>
			
			<p>If the aggressor is victorious, he retains initiative as aggressor, and there are additional effects as per 
			the Maneuver chosen. If the Defender is victorious, he may assume the part of the aggressor and possibly also 
			invoke additional effects as per his chosen Maneuver. In case of a tie, the aggressor simply retains this 
			role.</p>
			
			<p>If the first Exchange does not result in an immediate decision, a second Exchange follows, for which the 
			remainder of the SPs can be used, exactly as per the melee rules. If this Exchange does still not yield a 
			decision, the SPs refresh and a new Round of two Exchanges begins.</p>
			
			<p>The eventual loser of the duel is thrown to the ground bodily under the onslaught of his opponent’s 
			sorcerous power, where he lies stunned for the next Combat Round (all Pools at 0 dice). In addition, his 
			sorcerous defences have been invaded and battered down by his opponent: For the remainder of the scene, he is 
			at +2 TN to resist the victor’s sorceries and is at +2 Casting TN to affect the victor with his own sorcery. 
			Finally, he acquires 1 point of Taint. Depending on the actual Offensive Maneuver by which he was overcome, 
			the loser may also suffer physical damage on the Generic Damage Table. Armor Value never averts such injury, 
			but BN soaks up some of it as normal.</p>
			
			<p>While crippling injuries are entirely possible from a Duel of Wills, outright annihilation is rare. Wound 
			Levels 1 through 4 are attained normally, by a result (Impact Rating – half BN) of 1 to 4 respectively. Wound 
			Level 5 does however require a result of (Impact Rating – half BN) of 6+, and Wound Level 6 of 8+.</p>
			
			<p>Under certain circumstances a group of sorcerers may gang up on a single sorcerer, pooling their 
			ultramundane strength to best him. The circumstances under which this is possible and the mechanical aspects 
			of combining efforts are exactly as with Combining Sorcerous Efforts, as are the consequences of defeat (ex. 
			they are experienced by all to their full extent).</p>
			
			<p>The Duel of Wills is then handled normally, with the leader of each group of combatants making all decisions 
			and Checks. The only exception is that the Mystery used must remain the same throughout the contest. The 
			default physical aspect of a Duel of Wills is the two sorcerers staring at each other intently, maybe breaking 
			into sweat from the strain and swaying under the onslaught of the opponent’s will. For some settings it might 
			however be appropriate to be a bit gaudier. Lightning flickering between the sorcerers, gusts of wind tearing 
			at them, tongues of flame licking at them, vortexes full of barely glimpsed demonic entities wavering between 
			them are only a small portion of the possibilities.</p>
			
			<p>Lastly, Duel of Will may, at the ref’s discretion, be used between sorcerers and certain kinds of incorporeal 
			creatures, whom the ref would have to assign the equivalent of an SP. It can also be used for battles between 
			any hostile beings they encounter while using the Scrying Mystery, though the latter under these circumstances 
			is at a decided TN advantage, being as they are on their home ground.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_SorcerousManeuvers">Sorcerous Maneuvers</p>
			<p>All Maneuvers have an Activation Cost that has to be paid from the SP to utilize them. Some Maneuvers are 
			easier to use with SPs based on certain Mysteries. Any such Mystery is listed as “Favoured” with the Maneuver. 
			Activation Costs are 2 dice less if the SP used is based on a favoured Mystery, though never less than 0 dice, 
			with the sole exception of the Endure defense, which may add +2 dice to SP if used with the Mending Mystery. 
			Minimum Activation Costs are noted with the Maneuvers.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h3" id="P_OffensiveManeuvers">Offensive Maneuvers</p>
			<p class="h4" id="P_ATK_Creep">Creep</p>
			<p><em>Activation: 2 (minimum 0)</em></p>
			<p><em>Favoured: Necromancy, Prophecy, Scrying</em></p>
			
			<p>The attempt to find a weak spot in the opponent’s psychic defences and to get one’s assault through there. 
			It is in effect a feint: The aggressor at first declares another Offensive Maneuver and only announces Creep 
			once the defender has committed dice to a Defensive Maneuver. The aggressor may then add dice from his 
			uncommitted SP to those dice already committed to the attack at the additional Activation Cost of 1 die per 
			die added. The remainder of the offence is then resolved as if it was a Strike Maneuver.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_ATK_Grind">Grind</p>
			<p><em>Activation: 2 (minimum 0)</em></p>
			<p><em>Favoured: Cursing</em></p>
			
			<p>Grind is for keeping up a steady sorcerous assault to finally wear down the opponent’s defence. Assigned SP 
			are checked against Casting TN and Opposed by enemy’s chosen defense. If Grind is victorious, half the QoS is 
			added to the victor’s SP for the following Exchange, up to a maximum bonus dice equal to the number of dice 
			in his SP at the beginning of the following Exchange. Grind is no means to win a Duel of Wills in itself; some 
			other Offensive Maneuver is needed to finally deliver the decisive blow.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_ATK_Overpower">Overpower</p>
			<p><em>Activation: 6 (minimum 4)</em></p>
			<p><em>Favoured: Enslavement, Goety, Witchfire</em></p>
			
			<p>The tactic of the sorcerer sure of his own superiority, this is a brutal onslaught of eldritch power, 
			attempting to outright shatter the opponent’s defense. The assigned SP dice are checked against Casting TN and 
			Opposed by the enemy’s assigned defence dice. If the defender wins or ties, he may immediately assume the part 
			of aggressor.</p>
			
			<p>If the aggressor is victorious, he has brutally broken through the opponent’s defences and inflicts damage 
			of an Impact Rating equal to the total number of his Successes, not just those surpassing the defense 
			Successes.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_ATK_Strike">Strike</p>
			<p><em>Activation: 0 (minimum 0)</em></p>
			
			<p>The standard action of striking with one’s sorcerous power at the opponent. Check assigned dice against 
			Casting TN, opposed by enemy’s chosen defense. If victorious, the victor may simply retain initiative as 
			aggressor, or may alternatively choose to inflict damage of an Impact Rating equal to the QoS. If this Impact 
			Rating fails to inflict at least a level 1 wound, the attacker overestimated the power of his strike: The Duel 
			of Wills is still undecided and the previous defender assumes the role of the aggressor.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h3" id="P_DefensiveManeuvers">Defensive Maneuvers</p>
			<p class="h4" id="P_DEF_Counterstroke">Counterstroke</p>
			<p><em>Activation: 3 (minimum 1)</em></p>
			<p><em>Favoured: Cursing</em></p>
			
			<p>The finicky and difficult tactic of turning the opponent’s power against himself. Defence dice are assigned 
			and checked as normal, with a tie having the usual result of the aggressor retaining this role.</p>
			
			<p>If the defender surpasses the attacker’s number of Successes, he immediately becomes the aggressor and 
			attacks with a Strike on the very next Exchange (no choice here). He can assign as many dice from his SP as he 
			wants to this Strike, and will have additional bonus dice equal to the previous’ aggressor’s number of 
			Successes on the attack successfully defended against.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_DEF_Deflect">Deflect</p>
			<p><em>Activation: 0 (minimum 0)</em></p>
			
			<p>The standard tactic of simply deflecting the opponent’s sorcerous onslaught. If the number of Successes from 
			the assigned SP checked against Casting TN equals the aggressor’s attack Successes, the attack was deflected. 
			If it does not only equal, but actually exceed them, the defender may assume the mantle of aggressor.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_DEF_Endure">Endure</p>
			<p><em>Activation: 0 (minimum -2)</em></p>
			<p><em>Favoured: Mending (including Pain), Necromancy</em></p>
			
			<p>The tactic of hunkering down and taking everything the opponent throws at you in the hope that he will wear 
			himself out. If the defence is successful, no matter to what degree, the defender may still not assume the role 
			of aggressor. (See the sole exception below.) However, the aggressor for his next Exchange loses dice from his 
			SP equal to half the number of Successes on his attack; the successful defender, who took the punishment, 
			loses half as many dice as the aggressor, though always less than him (i.e. if the aggressor loses 1 die, 
			the defender loses 0 dice).</p>
			
			<p>If this results in the next Exchange starting with the current aggressor’s SP depleted and the current 
			defender still retaining dice in his SP, the latter may assume the part of aggressor.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_DEF_Evade">Evade</p>
			<p><em>Activation: 0 (minimum 0)</em></p>
			<p><em>Favoured: Prophecy</em></p>
			
			<p>The tactic of getting the hell out of the fight, only possible if the sorcerer wanting to utilize it did not 
			use an Offensive Maneuver in the immediately preceding Exchange; neither can this Maneuver be used on a 
			confrontation’s very first Exchange. The assigned defence dice are checked against Casting TN –2, and if they 
			at least tie the attack dice’s Successes, the Duel of Will is ended. It does however entail a certain degree 
			of acknowledgement of defeat and inferiority.</p>
			
			<p>For the remainder of the scene, the sorcerer ending a Duel of Wits by means of Evade is at Casting TN +1 to 
			affect his opponent with any sorcery, and the opponent affects him at Casting TN –1.</p>
