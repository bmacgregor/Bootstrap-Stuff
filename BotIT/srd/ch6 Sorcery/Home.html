			<p>Sorcery is not an academic, scholarly pursuit. Its practitioners do not theorize, do not engage in 
			complicated convoluted experiments, do not conduct research into sorcery’s underlying principles, or how to 
			apply them to novel uses.</p>
			
			<p>The actual inner workings of sorcery are unknowable, and even the greatest sorcerers can no more than dimly 
			guess at just why and how their invocations work. While sorcerers in Blade may or may not be erudite, bookish 
			types, they are no scientists. Sorcery is, after all, not science, but a strange, unknowable force of uncertain 
			origin, an origin that is usually somehow transmundane; it is never just another natural force like gravity or 
			magnetism. Instead, a degree of “outsideness” is always inherent to it.</p>

			<p class="h4">Sorcery Overview</p>
			<p>Sorcerers certainly have ideas where the sorcerous power they are manipulating derives from, but they can 
			never be certain. In one setting, it may be a dark power out of the void between the stars, in another, power 
			channelled from some eldritch and alien deity, or many other things. It is however never a beneficent or 
			wholesome power, and is likely impersonal.</p>
			
			<p>Those beings that impart and grant sorcerous power, always have an agenda of their own; an agenda that will 
			often be unfathomable, especially if such eldritch power is not derived from contact with supernatural, 
			godlike beings.</p>
			
			<p>This agenda is at best totally alien and entirely indifferent to human beings and their plight, and at 
			worst inimical to humanity. The former might be true in cases where sorcery is perceived as just a strange 
			power from beyond the limits of this universe, the latter in cases where it is channelled from some sinister 
			deity. In the very common instances where a given setting’s sorcery is derived from dealings with demonic 
			gods, sorcerers are usually to some degree worshippers or cultists of such deities or have formed pacts with 
			them. This does not mean that such sorcerers actually have to be devout – for many, it will be a pact, where 
			they further a demonic being’s agenda in return for receiving occult powers.</p>
			
			<p>This brings us to the topic of whence sorcery is learned. The fantasy trope of the apprenticeship to a 
			sorcerer is also alive in Blade, but it is not the sole, and in some settings perhaps not the most common, way 
			of acquiring sorcerous knowledge. Alongside it always exists the possibility of approaching a sorcerous deity – 
			provided such exists in the setting – and forging a pact with it to receive sorcerous knowledge in return for 
			whatever such an unfathomable, but never wholesome, being may require of a mere human. As only the most driven 
			and determined of men will head down such a path, it is usually strength of will and intensity of personality 
			that characterise a sorcerer in Blade, not intelligence and erudition.</p>
			
			<p>Ultimately, sorcery means always dealing with strange, alien, and inimical powers, whether personal, or 
			detached. As it is no science, it hardly attracts practitioners who are in it for the intellectual challenge 
			or insight offered, though it sometimes attracts curious practitioners of a philosophical bent. 
			Overwhelmingly, it attracts practitioners who are in it for sheer power. Much more often than scientists, 
			sorcerers will be priests, fanatical, sacrificial dagger wielding cultists of a god of darkness, or coolly 
			calculating schemers trying to get the maximum out of their sinister patron for a minimum of their own 
			involvement, perhaps even playing the dangerous game of playing one patron against another. But whatever they 
			are, they are never detached, ivory-tower scholars in pointy hats.</p>
			
			<p>Sorcery in Blade is therefore the manipulation of ultramundane powers that are at best alien and at worst 
			downright hostile towards humanity. In working sorcery, one exposes one’s body and soul to these inimical 
			powers.</p>
			
			<p>The wise sorcerer will refrain from overreaching himself and take good care not to open his soul’s portals 
			too far to the influences from beyond, lest he become tainted with them.</p>
			
			<p>Mechanically, sorcery rests on three legs. First, there are the six Lesser Mysteries, of which the 
			occasional hedge wizard, shaman, or cultist may know one or two. Then there are the two Greater Mysteries, 
			powerful magics that are the sole domain of dedicated sorcerers. Finally, there are the Arcane Secrets, 
			mythical feats of great magic, the stuff of sorcerous legends, known to only the very greatest of 
			sorcerers.</p>
			
			<p>How Arcane Secrets are learned is a special case explained later, but Lesser and Greater Mysteries are 
			learned in a fashion similar to weapon Proficiencies. At character creation, ratings in Mysteries are bought 
			with points from the Proficiency priority. As with Attributes and Skills, the maximum rating that can be 
			attained in any Mystery is 8, with a rating of 9 allowed in a single Mystery.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_SorceryPool">1. The Sorcery Pool</p>
			<p>The Mystery score is only one half of the Sorcery Pool, hereafter SP. The other half is Power, the 
			sorcerer’s innate ability to create magic.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Power = (Sagacity + Tenacity + Brawn + Bonus) / 3</strong></p>
			
			<p>The Bonus is equal the number of Mysteries the sorcerer is proficient in, but never higher than the rating 
			of the Mystery he is most proficient in.</p>
			
			<p>The SP available for any sorcerous action is thus Power + Mystery. SP dice are split into two parts, with a 
			minimum of 1 die in each. The first of these parts is to work the sorcery, to make the Casting Check, and the 
			second to contain the eldritch powers invoked, to make the Containment Check.</p>
			
			<p>The base TNs of these Checks vary with the Sorcery Priority the character is built upon:</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Dabbler (C Priority) : Target Number 8</li>
				<li>Sorcerer (B Priority) : Target Number 7</li>
				<li>Mysteriarch (A Priority) : Target Number 6</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>First, the Mystery, to achieve the effect, is checked against the appropriate TN. Depending on the sorcery, 
			this Casting Check may be an Opposed one; for specifics, see the various Mysteries and Arcane Secrets. 1 
			Success will usually be sufficient to achieve some kind of effect, but more may be required for the desired 
			magnitude of effect; details on this can also be found within the description of the various Mysteries and 
			Arcane Secrets.</p>
			
			<p>Once the Check for the effect is made, the second half of the SP must be Checked immediately to contain the 
			effect. This Containment Check is made against TN 7, and at least as many Successes as on the Casting Check 
			are required to fully contain the sorcerous energies; for every Success short, the sorcerer accumulates one 
			point of Taint. If the Containment Check does not yield at least half as many Successes as the Casting Check, 
			the effect is uncontained. In such cases, the sorcery takes effect as intended but also turns against the 
			sorcerer himself. This takes the form of a Complication to be effected by the ref at the earliest opportunity. 
			Often, this will be a side or minor effect of the sorcery turning against the sorcerer himself, or against 
			somebody he does not wish ensorcelled, but it can also take the form of entirely mundane unpleasantries 
			arising directly from his sorcery.</p>
			
			<p>Optionally, any uncontained effect (i.e. Containment Check yields less than half the Successes of the 
			Casting Check) can additionally cause the sorcerer physical damage from eldritch energies turning against 
			himself. If this rule is used, inflict a level 1 wound from the Generic Damage Table upon the sorcerer every 
			time one of his effects is uncontained, or a level 2 wound if the Containment Check doesn’t even yield a single 
			Success.</p>
			
			<p>Depending on the setting, this may manifest as withering, bleeding, scorching, or another form of generic 
			damage that cannot be negated by use of the It’s Only a Scratch mechanic.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_Taint">2. Taint</p>
			<p>In working magic, the sorcerer opens himself up to alien, transmundane powers, and if he is not careful, 
			these powers will leave their mark on him. This metaphysical stench is called Taint.</p>
			
			<p>Every Success on the Casting Check theoretically imparts one point of Taint to the sorcerer, minus one point 
			for each Success of the Containment Check, down to an absolute minimum of 0. No Containment Check can reduce 
			the sorcerer’s Taint score below what it was before the present sorcery was wrought.</p>
			
			<p>Taint interferes with the working of further sorcery and also imparts an aura of sinister otherworldliness 
			to the character that is disturbing to man and beast alike. Depending on the severity of a character’s current 
			Taint, dice are subtracted from his SP, and additional Successes are required on all Checks for non-hostile 
			interaction with both beast and men, as per the Taint Effect Table 26.</p>
			
			<br/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_TaintEffects">Taint Effects</p>
			<table class="table table-striped table-hover" id="TBL_TaintEffects">
				<thead>
					<th>Taint</th>
					<th>Sorcery Pool Penalty</th>

			<p>The additional Successes required for successful interaction do not apply to interaction with sorcerous 
			creatures and animals that have a reputation in the setting as being sorcerous themselves (e.g. cats, ravens, 
			toads, etc.), but does apply to interaction with other sorcerers. Taint fades over time. Every 12 hours, at 
			concrete, setting-specific times (e.g. moonrise, sunset, midnight, etc.), Taint is reduced by 1, provided no 
			new Taint was acquired during the last 12 hours. Taint can also be reduced in various ways:</p>
			
			<p>Player characters with a faith-related PA can attempt to reduce their current Taint by praying and offering 
			up a sacrifice at an appropriately consecrated locale. After the sacrifice the faith-related PA is checked 
			against TN 7, with the number of Successes deducted from the current Taint rating. No more than one such 
			sacrifice per week is possible.</p>
			
			<p>Alternatively, the sorcerer can conduct a ritual of purification, which might also take the form of some 
			nefarious rite in the case of sorcerers invoking some supernatural patron for their power. Such a ritual 
			requires about 12 hours during which nothing else can be done, and will, depending on the setting and the 
			culture, involve chanting, meditation, drug-induced trances and the like. After the ritual is conducted, the 
			sorcerer checks Power against TN 7, with every Success reducing his current Taint by 1 point.</p>
			
			<p>Finally, Taint can also reduce itself in a backlash. For this to occur the sorcerer’s current Taint must at 
			least be equal to his HT and he must either acquire at least another 3 points of Taint at once or else cast 
			some uncontained sorcery (i.e. Containment Successes less than half Casting Successes). In such a case, the 
			Taint discharges itself, usually in the guise of a curse (see the Cursing Mystery). This discharge cuts the 
			sorcerer’s Taint rating in half (again, round up fractions of 0.50 and above), but the sorcerer becomes victim 
			of a curse with a curse rating equal to the number of Taint points that were lost in the discharge.</p>
			
			<p>In some settings it might be more fitting to have the Taint backlash assume the form of some temporary 
			physical affliction like a twisted limb, a bulging eye, scales instead of skin, or a third eye popping up in 
			some conspicuous area of the body, or anything else that fits the flavour of sorcery in the setting. Such an 
			affliction will have the game effects of requiring 1 or more additional Successes on one or more broad types 
			of action (social interaction, physical exertion, mental exercises, etc.). Each penalty of 1 thus imparted 
			reduces the curse rating from the Taint backlash by 1. No more than half the original curse rating may be thus 
			converted.</p>
			
			<p>These afflictions last until the curse from the Taint discharge has run its course and then fade. In some 
			settings, it might be desirable to have some very minor and certainly non-debilitating trace of the afflictions 
			remain, like a scar from a wound.</p>
			
			<p>If the group feels that even more gruesome additional consequences are appropriate for their setting, that 
			should be easy to enact. They might for example decide that any Taint backlash of a certain magnitude 
			immediately deducts one point from the sorcerer’s HT Attribute, only to be regained through normal character 
			development mechanics.</p>
			
			<p>Finally, and independently of any additional Taint mechanics, if the optional rule about insufficient 
			containment causing damage is used, any damage suffered from an uncontained sorcery that also causes a Taint 
			backlash is increased by 1 level (to a theoretical maximum of 3).</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_CombiningSorcerousEfforts">3. Combining Sorcerous Efforts</p>
			<p>In <em>Blade</em>, sorcerers are a rare commodity, most especially those knowing more than one or two 
			Lesser Mysteries. Thus, there will seldom be a situation when several sorcerers combine their arcane powers. 
			When they do, despite everything, it is an absolute necessity for the combination of such efforts that the 
			cooperating sorcerers belong to the same cult, coven, or sorcerous order.</p>
			
			<p>Merely practicing sorcery of the same general cultural tradition is not enough; actual membership in some 
			kind of shared sorcerous brotherhood is indispensable. If this prerequisite is met, while it is not necessary 
			that every sorcerer partaking in this pooling of power know the particular Mystery being used, it is 
			beneficial.</p>
			
			<p>The sorcerer with the highest rating in the Mystery being attempted (not the sorcerer with the largest 
			Sorcery Pool), heads the effort, and his pool is the one modified. Dice from each participating sorcerer are 
			cumulatively added to his SP thusly:</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>+1 to the caster’s pool if the contributor knows a Lesser Mystery</li>
				<li>+1 to the caster’s pool if the contributor knows more than three Lesser Mysteries</li>
				<li>+1 to the caster’s pool if the contributor knows a Greater Mystery</li>
				<li>+1 to the caster’s pool if the contributor knows two Greater Mysteries</li>
				<li>+1 to the caster’s pool if the contributor knows any Arcane Secrets</li>
				<li>-1 to the caster’s pool if a Lesser Mystery is being cast that is unknown to the contributor</li>
				<li>-2 to the caster’s pool if a Greater Mystery or Arcane Secret are being cast that is unknown to the 
				contributor</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>The downside of such combined sorcerous efforts is that its consequences are not merely confined to the 
			primary caster, but afflict every participant in full. This includes both Taint and any other negative effects 
			resulting from insufficiently successful Containment Checks – they afflict every participating sorcerer in 
			their entirety.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_AffectingMultipleTargets">4. Affecting Multiple Targets</p>
			<p>Sorcerers can affect more than one victim at once with a single application of the Cursing, Enslavement, and 
			Mending Mysteries. The targets affected must all constitute a group, either in the sense of their physical 
			proximity (with no non-members of the group interspersed between them), or else in another, clearly delineated 
			sense; for example, a sorcerer could affect all present redheads, or eunuchs, or priests, even if those are 
			mixed into a larger group.</p>
			
			<p>Casting and Containment Checks are made as usual, but 1 Casting Success is discarded for every target after 
			the first. The remaining Casting Successes are Opposed as by the mechanics for the Mystery used, but only once, 
			by the single target with the best chances to succeed at resisting the Mystery. The outcome of this single 
			Check determines whether the sorcery overcomes the resistance of all targets; if it fails, all targets are 
			affected, if it is successful, no target is affected.</p>
			
			<div class="panel-body bg-warning" id="DIV_Example_AffectMultipleTargets">
				<p><em><strong>Example</strong>: : A sorcerer uses Pain against three guardsmen charging him. He achieves 6 
				Casting Successes, of which 2 are discarded for the two additional targets. The guardsmen with the best TY 
				Checks this Attribute to oppose the 4 Casting Successes. If he achieves 4 or more Successes, no guardsman 
				is affected; if he achieves less than 4 Successes, all three guardsmen suffer Pain 12.</p>
				
				<p>The Witchfire Mystery can also be used against several targets at once, with the same mechanic of 
				discarding Casting Successes for additional targets. The reduced number of Casting Successes are used both 
				for damage calculation and for the attack rolls. Unlike with the other Mysteries, Checks to hit and avoid 
				the Witchfire attack are made individually, for every target and by every target.</em></p>
