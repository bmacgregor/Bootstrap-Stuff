			<p>This chapter takes a look at the setting, the protagonists and the structure of the typical Sword & Sorcery 
			tale. It shows the common traits of the many variants of the genre and attempts to aid both referees and 
			players alike in getting a feel for the conventions of Sword & Sorcery, to better allow them to create settings 
			and characters appropriate for the genre.</p>
			
			<p>For the sake of demonstrating what the tales have in common, a degree of generalisation is inevitable. 
			Please be aware that no writer has at all times followed all of the tenets explained in this chapter, and so 
			you too should feel free to ignore those that do not suit you. But please be also aware that while you can and 
			should well deviate in a few precepts, you will be rapidly abandoning the field of Sword & Sorcery if you 
			deviate in more than a handful at once. If that’s what you want, fine, go ahead, more power to you, just be 
			conscious of it.</p>

			<p class="h4">The World of Sword & Sorcery</p>
			<p>A Sword & Sorcery world is almost always a harsh place where violence and even outright cruelty are quite 
			commonplace. The world or the relevant part of it may be outright lawless, but it need not be; if it is, it 
			will usually abound with pockets of lawless behaviour where might makes right, either because a central 
			authority is non-existent, or too weak to keep the peace, or simply does not bother to do it. Callous and 
			corrupt regimes interested in nothing but the perpetuation of their own power and comfort would be typical, 
			as would be regimes whose authority and hold over their countries is undermined by contenders, rebel, war or 
			raiders, or maybe by the sheer size of the land and the remoteness of the government. In any case, the setting 
			for Sword & Sorcery tales is one where violence is not or not effectively monopolized by whatever government 
			there happens to be.</p>
			
			<p>The majority of people in Sword & Sorcery stories usually do little to alleviate the harshness of the 
			violent world. Self-serving and callous people are common, and only a minority of people can be considered 
			altruistic – which is of course not to say that the latter don’t exist at all. While decent people do exist and 
			actually figure quite frequently in Sword & Sorcery stories, it is universally understood that they constitute 
			the minority and mostly figure as a device to throw the utter selfishness of the majority into starker 
			relief.</p>
			
			<p>By and large, most people will have little interest in anything but their own advantage, and compassion 
			will, if they feel it at all, be limited largely to their thoughts and only rarely enter their deeds. Combined 
			with this uncaring attitude, the abundance of violence and the utter egoism of the typical government, make the 
			Sword & Sorcery world into a tragic place. While most common people do not of course have to contend with the 
			threat of a violent end on a daily basis, the menace of it is ever present in the background, and almost 
			everyone will have personally experienced situations where somebody’s life was either ruined or outright 
			terminated by rampant violence or the uncaring arbitrariness of people in power.</p>
			
			<p>It is typical that in spite of these tragedies, the people of the Sword and Sorcery world do not strive to 
			make their world a better place. The response of the majority is either selfishly looking only after themselves 
			and their own prosperity and safety, or else outright fatalism, or a combination of both.</p>
			
			<p>In extreme cases, such a combination might lead to an utterly decadent world where everybody feels powerless 
			in the face of fate and does, while he waits for his turn for fate to strike him inevitably down, look only to 
			his own pleasure and immediate advantage. This latter setting is a subset of the Sword & Sorcery world, a 
			decadent, fatalistic, and often also quite sophisticated, wicked and sybaritic type.</p>
			
			<p>It provides a distinctive flavour of its own and therefore serves more often as the backdrop for stories of 
			the cloak-and-dagger type that play out rather in opulent pleasure palaces and the dark back streets of 
			ancient metropolises than in the wilderness or on battlefields. But there is of course nothing to keep a 
			referee from providing his very own Sword & Sorcery setting with different areas suffused with either type of 
			flavour, the savagely violent and the wickedly depraved.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_FaithAndTheDivine">Faith and the Divine</p>
			<p>Almost all Sword & Sorcery settings lack direct manifestations of the divine. The priests will typically run 
			the gamut; from scholars to Machiavellian plotters to ritualists humbugging either themselves or their flock, 
			but they will – with one notable exception – never be recipients of any kind of special supernatural powers of 
			divine origin. There are no “clerical spells”, and miracles are thus stuff of religious legend, with no game 
			mechanics to regulate the contingency of their appearance.</p>
			
			<p>The only priests who receive any kind of powers from their deities are usually the celebrants of evil, 
			forbidden and secret cults, and they can rather be considered sorcerers having received preternatural knowledge 
			and powers from their ultramundane patrons – typically at a cost. These cultists, turning to almost universally 
			malignant entities for arcane power and wisdom are the magic users of the genre and will be more thoroughly 
			dealt with in the next section.</p>
			
			<p>Religion in Sword & Sorcery can be monotheistic, but will more usually be polytheistic. Religious practices 
			are frequently steeped in convoluted ritual, or actually consisting of them entirely, with sacrificial rites 
			common. With the darker cults, this can definitely include human sacrifice. The faithful almost certainly 
			believe in divine intervention, but actual intervention is exceedingly rare. Mostly, the gods, if they do 
			exist at all, are remote and uncaring; when they do show their hands at all it is more likely that it will be 
			to punish and cast down than to rescue and reward.</p>
			
			<p>Pantheons of gods that are not regarded as benevolent but rather need to be appeased to spare humanity 
			their wrath are therefore more common in Sword & Sorcery than in other genres, but still overly in the 
			minority. While common people in the setting may well be deeply devout, the attitude of the protagonists is 
			more often than not a deeply self-sufficient one of trying to avoid the gods as much as possible.</p>
			
			<p>Most heroes of Sword & Sorcery respect divine power and will rarely insult it, but by and large avoid 
			treading on any deity’s shadow. Exceptionally devout protagonists are the exception – the majority feel that 
			there is no use turning to a god for something one can, by sweat and supreme effort, achieve oneself. Even a 
			protagonist as deeply religious as Howard’s Solomon Kane displays this latter attitude of self-reliance over 
			reliance on divine agency.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_MagicAndTheSupernatural">Magic and the Supernatural</p>
			<p>Even though it is in the name of the genre, magic need not actually be real in a world of Sword & Sorcery, 
			though it usually will be. In the rare cases where magic does not exist, it will still be practically 
			universally believed in, to such a degree that it might be preferable not to inform the players that it is 
			all rank superstition and that magic does not actually work.</p>
			
			<p>However, the default is for magic to be very real, but never commonplace. In Sword & Sorcery, true magic is 
			always rare, rather powerful, mysterious, and not completely understood even by its practitioners – and most 
			of all, it is menacing and strange to the point of being outright alien.</p>
			
			<p>Only seldom will magic work by drawing upon some anonymous force pervading the universe – usually the 
			source of magic is either a force or entity inimical to life or at least humanity, and by working magic the 
			sorcerer is endangering his sanity, soul or humanity, or even all of them. Acts of sorcery, especially the 
			more powerful ones, will often involve blood sacrifice and similar unpleasantries. It should by now have 
			become apparent that sorcerers in Sword & Sorcery tales are rarely nice guys – at best they are shady and 
			ambiguous, and often they are outright hell-raising fiends. Owing to the danger that sorcery represents to its 
			own practitioners, sorcerers are usually driven people with a strong will and great self-discipline.</p>
			
			<p>It does after all take a certain kind of person to risk his life, and probably also soul or sanity, and flirt 
			with eternal damnation. This does make sorcerers the perfect villain of the Sword & Sorcery tale and only 
			marginally suitable as PCs.</p>
			
			<p>Magic in Sword & Sorcery is universally subtle and never worked quickly, but rather the product of more or 
			less lengthy ritual. Its effects are not obvious, or necessarily magical to the onlooker, and they are almost 
			never flashy. The sorcerer of this genre may converse with the dead, scry out distant places, magically enslave 
			people to his sovereign will, inflict wasting plagues upon those who irk him, command the weather, fool with 
			hallucinations, curse his enemies with terrible dooms, summon demons to do his bidding and maybe even shake the 
			very earth to bring down entire cities, but he will not throw lightning from his fingertips nor mass-produce 
			magical items. Such items of power are invariably rare in tales of Sword & Sorcery, with most campaigns 
			playing out without a single magical item ever turning up. When magic items do exist they are usually the 
			stuff of legend and eminently powerful, on a level with Excalibur and the Holy Grail, and are quite frequently 
			cursed or otherwise doom-laden. If they appear at all, they take center stage and are the very focus of an 
			entire adventure, or better yet, a series of adventures.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_RacialMakeupOfS&S">The Racial Makeup of Sword & Sorcery</p>
			<p>With magic and the supernatural being so rare, it will not come as a surprise that non-human races are 
			equally rare in Sword & Sorcery. This is a world of humans, and while non-humans do exist they are relegated 
			to legend and the very fringe of the setting. Such beings are never commonplace and almost never integrated 
			to any degree into human society, or even familiar with it.</p>
			
			<p>Rather, they represent the uncanny, the alien, and the utterly inhuman. Bitter survivors of anterior races, 
			scattered communities plotting the eventual downfall of man, degenerated descendants of elder races preying 
			upon man, reclusive and solitary guardians of pre-human wisdom, those are the usual roles for non-humans in 
			Sword & Sorcery, but certainly not one of sharing the quintessentially human world with any degree of equality 
			or amicability. What non-humans figure in Sword & Sorcery are anything but humans with pointed ears; rather, 
			they are ultimately unfathomable and unknowable and thus quintessentially non-human.</p>
			
			<p>The role of the non-human in the Sword & Sorcery adventure is therefore similar to that of the magic item, 
			though maybe to a lesser degree: When one figures in an adventure, he will be central to it and much of the 
			adventure will revolve around him. The same does of course apply to monsters, those well-loved number one 
			enemies of role-playing heroes: In Sword & Sorcery, they are ousted from this position. Here, the most 
			common adversary of the hero is his fellow man, and monsters occupy a similarly special place as non-humans. 
			If they appear in the stories, they will not fulfil the role of the common orc, to be slaughtered in untold 
			numbers, but rather the role of Grendel or Count Dracula: The focus and backbone of an entire adventure, or a 
			recurring plot device on the way to the climax. It follows that they usually appear singly or at best in tiny, 
			closely connected groups, for example Grendel and his mother. They are individual horrors, capable of 
			single-handedly menacing all of the characters in a story – and slaying more than a few.</p>
			
			<p>In Sword & Sorcery, the role of non-humans and monsters is a similar one: Both represent an encounter with 
			the uncanny. Conan doesn’t typically fight through hordes of monsters the way he does hordes of men, nor do 
			Clark Ashton Smith’s various heroes. Even where Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser confront monsters with steel, they 
			only once or twice battle them in great numbers. Elric is the exception but even then only occasionally. And 
			even more recent Sword & Sorcery heroes, like Hercules or Xena, rarely battle more than one true monster at a 
			time – and they live in an age of monsters. In the few cases in the source literature where monsters appear in 
			groups, the hero’s solution is almost always to run, while villainous or simply less wary men are 
			slaughtered.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_HeroesAndVillains">Heroes & Villains</p>
			<p>The heroes of Sword & Sorcery come in many different shapes and sizes. Some, like Elric, are deeply 
			introspective intellectuals, others, like Conan, are indomitable fighting men, others, like the Gray Mouser, 
			are sly bounders, others, like Cyrion, are suave sophisticates, and yet again others, like Kane, are simply 
			badasses; with Myal Lemyal there is even an outright goofball among the heroes of the genre. The genre abounds 
			with many different types of protagonists, and by far not all them meet their opposition head-on and weapon in 
			hand. But however divergent their method, outlook on life, and temperament may be, there are a few underlying, 
			unifying traits they all have in common.</p>
			
			<p>The Sword & Sorcery hero is usually a stranger, outcast or outlaw, an alien or a misfit in the region where 
			his tale plays out, apart from and outside of that locale’s community. He is often, but not always, of humble 
			descent, a commoner, former slave or outright barbarian. In cases where he hails from the higher classes of 
			society he is either discredited, disinherited or irrevocably deposed from his once lofty position. He comes 
			from the very lowest stratum of the upper class – the lowest of the mighty. He lives by his brawn or cunning, 
			and often by both. His personal capabilities are remarkable and lift him head and shoulders above the masses. 
			By their virtue, he imposes his own brand of law upon desolate wilderness and sophisticated civilisation alike. 
			He is as gregarious and as fond of companionship as the next person, but at the end of the day he is his own 
			man and utterly self-reliant. This self-reliance typically extends to his attitude towards gods and the 
			divine.</p>
			
			<p>While he may be a deep thinker and even an outright intellectual, he is always a man of action. When a 
			decision is called for, he does not hesitate or lose himself in doubt, but acts. This doesn’t mean that he 
			plunges head over heels into hasty action, but rather that he is neither afraid to act nor paralyzed by 
			pondering the possible consequences. When the circumstances call for it, even a Sword & Sorcery hero who is 
			usually a brooder will be able to quickly arrive at a decision and then have the guts to follow it through.</p>
			
			<p>As he exists in a harsh and violent world, the Sword & Sorcery hero is typically himself a harsh person who 
			does not shrink from violence – he has to be to survive, let alone prosper and further his goals. He well may, 
			like Solomon Kane, be utterly dedicated to the pursuit of selfless and ulterior motives, but even if he is, he 
			is almost never “good” in the conventional sense of the world – too uncompromising would best describe the 
			righteous Sword & Sorcery hero, all too ready to dish out his own brand of summary justice, and incredibly 
			callous towards those he judges to be wicked.</p>
			
			<p>But this type of hero is in the minority; the clear majority of Sword & Sorcery heroes are hardly heroic in 
			the conventional sense. Products of selfish and uncaring societies, they are usually ruthless and self-serving. 
			Only a few of them shrink from acts of savage violence, theft and even outright murder and rapine. They are 
			out to make a living in a tragic, cruel and unforgiving world, and they are ready to do whatever it takes, by 
			means foul or fair.</p>
			
			<p>Nevertheless, there is a fine clear line that divides the hero from the villain, a line the hero will almost 
			never cross. Unlike the villain, the hero does typically treat people the way they treat him. Strangers and 
			enemies are fair prey for whatever the hero deigns to visit upon them, but his friends, companions, and those 
			he has shared danger with are at the very least exempt from the hero’s depredations, and will often find him a 
			faithful friend who will treat them fairly. This even extends to respected and honourable enemies, who will 
			normally be treated with a kind of rough chivalry. For as long as those close to the hero play fair by him, he 
			will play fair by them.</p>
			
			<p>The Sword & Sorcery villain on the other hand will not shrink from stabbing anybody in the back, even 
			companions who have never done anything but right by him. This is what constitutes villainy in Sword & 
			Sorcery: Acknowledging no bounds to one’s self-serving behaviour, and being more than ready to treat everybody, 
			even friends and allies, as mere stepping stones on one’s own egoistic path.</p>
			
			<p>While the villain will readily prey on everybody, the hero will at least exempt friends and – this is 
			important – those he has shared danger with, from his own depredations. This is the dividing line. The hero, 
			as savage and maybe even cruel as he may be, is harsh and violent because that’s the way of a world where one 
			has to be strong and possibly without mercy, but he exempts those who have in their previous behaviour towards 
			him not been part of the harshness and violence of the world. The villain exempts nobody. All people, even 
			those treating him with kindness and consideration, are but tools to him.</p>
			
			<p>Even though this is not necessary, Sword & Sorcery affords the player at least the opportunity to portray 
			true bastards, but however cold-blooded and callous a player character may be, it is of paramount importance 
			that he does not cross the line into the realm where he becomes a predator to all of humankind. A typical Sword 
			& Sorcery hero will often do some very amoral, wicked and outright vicious things, but this behaviour needs to 
			be balanced with at least some degree of decency on his part. If this decency is missing, he totally lacks any 
			redeeming quality. Such a protagonist is disgusting; watching his exploits lacking any glimpse of even 
			vestigial propriety, and he is hardly suitable to fulfil the role of the protagonist of something that should, 
			with all its grittiness, be an entertaining pastime.</p>
			
			<p>If there is a single tenet of Sword & Sorcery that must not be broken it would be this. The hero, no matter 
			how depraved otherwise – and he need not necessarily be depraved at all – must never cross the line into 
			completely anti-social behaviour.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_TheS&STale">The Sword & Sorcery Tale</p>
			<p>It should now hardly come as a surprise that Sword & Sorcery adventures are not about the exploits of heroes 
			in shining armour on white steeds, but rather about protagonists out for very private reasons. In this genre, 
			stakes tend to be personal.</p>
			
			<p>The Sword & Sorcery hero is never questing to save the world; instead, he is usually motivated by revenge, 
			trying to save his own butt, or out to make a splash. Many will be totally indifferent to the classic damsel 
			in distress, though there are quite a few Sword & Sorcery heroes who seem to display a peculiar kind of – 
			very rough! – chivalry towards women. Consequently, the antagonists are typically not vicious people whose 
			nefarious plans have to be thwarted by the virtuous heroes. Often they are rivals who happen to be after the 
			same goal as the heroes, who want to thwart the heroes’ pursuit of this goal, or simply personal enemies 
			trying to get back at them for some real or perceived slight, or maybe somebody with whom the heroes unluckily 
			cross paths.</p>
			
			<p>On occasion the antagonist is somebody from whom a hero has to protect people close to him, though such an 
			unselfish motivation is somewhat of an exception. By and large, the hero is out to attain a goal that would be 
			of immediate benefit to himself (personal gain, survival, escape), or to aid a friend of his, but never to 
			further the common good.</p>
			
			<p>As the supernatural is always rare in Sword & Sorcery, the majority of the antagonists will be human. When 
			non-human antagonists appear, they are always central to the adventure, in such a way that they are effectively 
			adventures in and of themselves – even when the object of the adventure isn’t to slay the monster. Where 
			non-human antagonists appear, a few points usually apply universally:</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>The monster is not necessarily there to be slain. (Though, to be sure, it probably can be. Monsters are 
				generally as mortal as anything else.) Often the objective is to avoid being slain by the monster</li>
				
				<li>The monster is formidable enough to challenge several PCs at once</li>
				
				<li>Most of the lesser – human – bad guys are not minions or cultists of the monster, but rivals of the 
				PCs in whatever goal the PCs happen to pursue</li>
				
				<li>The monster’s lair is as dangerous to the lesser bad guys as it is to the PCs, and quite a few of these 
				lesser bad guys may well be slain through the monster’s agency</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>As is often the case with Sword & Sorcery gaming, horror provides a better model for stories than high 
			fantasy adventures. In the classic Sword & Sorcery tale the monster is a series of foreshadowed dangers and 
			actual hazards that may, later in the game, blossom into an actual confrontation.</p>
			
			<p>The locales where Sword & Sorcery tales are set vary widely, but are often exotic, and when not desolate, 
			resonate heavily with the flavour of the setting. Dangerous backstreets of wicked cities, a countryside ravaged 
			by war, the marble halls of opulent palaces, the encampment of a mercenary company, a pirate ship on the high 
			seas, a military encampment on the edge of civilisation, a caravan of slavers, a squalid camp of refugees and 
			the like would all be perfect examples.</p>
			
			<p>The second type of the locales are the desolate ones: Ruins of a lost civilisation, the abandoned temple of 
			a forbidden deity, an inimical wilderness, an island shown on no map, the spider-haunted crypt of an ancient 
			king, the forbidding lair of a legendary evil, and similarly hostile and mysterious places. These isolated 
			locales will more often be the setting for adventures revolving around non-human menaces, who by virtue of 
			being not integrated into human society, are usually found on the desolate edge of civilisation.</p>
			
			<p>The exception to this would of course be supernatural menaces that have been able to somehow insinuate 
			themselves secretly into human society, like for instance vampires or maybe a thing inhabiting a temple and 
			passing itself off as deity. But whatever the locale of the Sword & Sorcery tale may be, it is never ever 
			boring. It is exotic, or colourful, or even terrifying, but always an interesting place, though not one the 
			wise would visit.</p>
			
			<p>The pace of Sword & Sorcery adventures is fast and furious, with rarely a scene lacking action or conflict. 
			Long stretches of quietude, where heroes gather information, or set up a convoluted intrigue, are absent from 
			this kind of adventure. Not every scene needs to have mad action – nor should it –, but where it is absent 
			there should at least be a fair degree of tension, menace or some kind of non-physical conflict; for instance, 
			if a scene consists of nothing but conversation, these conversations should be laden with veiled threats, 
			undercurrents of hostility or other elements adding tension to an otherwise peaceful stretch of adventure. For 
			the referee this means that he must under no circumstance allow the PCs to spend time just stalling, preparing, 
			scouting, chatting, or otherwise passing long spans of time in secure complacency. Events, namely those of the 
			exciting, rousing kind, should progress briskly, and if the PCs stray down a quiet side alley of the adventure 
			for overlong, the referee has to hit them with unfolding events.</p>
			
			<p>The worlds of Sword & Sorcery aren’t safe places, they don’t wait for their heroes, and they certainly don’t 
			afford them opportunities to stall; if they do, events are likely to overtake them at a furious, 
			heart-throbbing pace. To convey this, the referee should use NPCs, especially villains, who don’t just sit 
			around and wait for the PCs, but who actively pursue their own agendas; if the PCs want to thwart them or beat 
			them to some goal, they have to act, and act decisively.</p>
			
			<p>This concludes the overview over what Sword & Sorcery tales are like and what Blade adventures should be 
			like. At the very end, once more a very quick checklist of the most important and elementary corner stones of 
			the genre:</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Settings are harsh – various combinations of corrupt, violent, decadent and callous</li>
				
				<li>Heroes are often, though not always, bastards, with most having reservations about being total 
				bastards</li>
				
				<li>Magic is mysterious, often rare and powerful and dangerous to its users, but without flashy effects</li>
				
				<li>Supernatural and non-human beings rare and when they appear are central to the adventure</li>
				
				<li>Human opponents are often not direct enemies, but rivals in the pursuit of a goal</li>
				
				<li>Stakes in adventures are personal, not global</li>
				
				<li>Events in adventures progress at a fast pace</li>
			</ul>

			<p class="h4" id="P_20Tips">Twenty Tips for running your <em>Blade</em> game</p>
			<p><strong>Keep it exciting.</strong> Everything that follows is an extension of this simple truth. The key to 
			Blade is to keep it exciting, entertaining, and surprising. This is the responsibility of the ref and the 
			players alike.</p>
			
			<ol>
				<li><p><strong>Go Get Some Books</strong></p>
				<p>Grab some Sword & Sorcery novels and read them, then encourage everyone in your group to read them too. 
				The annotated bibliography in the appendices will aid you in finding something to your very own tastes. 
				This is the stuff on which Blade is based, so there’s no better source of inspiration for your games. 
				Movies will do if you’ve got no alternatives, but it just isn’t the same.</p></li>
				
				<hr/>
				
				<li><p><strong>The Fray's the Thing</strong></p>
				<p>Combat is the heart of Blade, and the heart of combat is the maneuvering. Every attack in combat should 
				be as creative and detailed and possible. Never simply say “I kick the guy,” or “I swing at him.” Explain 
				how you’re doing it, and make it exciting! Visualize your character as if he were on a movie screen, and 
				use all the scenery and the props at your disposal. If you don’t know what I mean, go rent Brotherhood of 
				the Wolf right now and study the fight scenes. Think about how they do it in the movies, and then transfer 
				that style to the game.</p>
				
				<p>Blade combat should be fast, fluid, and constantly jumping. The fun is based a mostly on how well you 
				and your friends pull this off.</p></li>
				
				<hr/>
				
				<li><p><strong>Do it With Style</strong></p>
				<p>Blade characters are action heroes. That means that not only can they do cool things, but they look cool 
				doing them. Everything should be done with flair, panache, and attitude. Remember, you’re one of the big 
				fish, so act like it.</p></li>
				
				<hr/>
				
				<li><p><strong>Subtlety isn't a Virture</strong></p>
				<p>Everything in Blade should be larger than life. This doesn’t just apply to the action either; melodrama 
				is a staple of S&S novels. Betrayal, loyalty, honor, and revenge are all common themes, and they should be 
				played to the hilt. When your mortal enemy reappears, and your sweetheart turns up murdered, don’t be 
				lukewarm, that’s not interesting. This is your time in the spotlight — go nuts!</p></li>
				
				<hr/>
				
				<li><p><strong>Everyone Has a Past</strong></p>
				<p>Melodramatic hooks are not only one of the fundamental keys to defining your character; they’re also a 
				fertile source for plot twists and surprises. Everyone has a past, and thus everyone has a purpose. Grab 
				your Passion Attributes and have a blast! Maybe you’re out for revenge, or maybe you’re out for redemption. 
				Maybe you’re looking for something, or maybe you’re trying not to be found. Maybe you’ve lost your memory, 
				or maybe you’re trying to forget. What matters is that you’re trying to do something, and the more defined 
				the better.</p>
				
				<p>With a little cooperation from both sides of the table, there’s always room to introduce long-lost 
				family or traitorous friends who are out to get you.</p></li>
				
				<hr/>
				
				<li><p><strong>Don't Loot the Bodies</strong></p>
				<p>It’s crass. This may be a standard practice in other RPGs, but it just isn’t done in Blade. When was the 
				last time you read about any S&S hero rifling through the bad guys’ clothes for a few coins? It’s perfectly 
				acceptable to search the bodies for vital clues, or just to grab their weapons if you need them, but loot 
				is rarely an issue. You can usually get whatever you need anyway, so don’t be a creep.</p></li>
				
				<hr/>
				
				<li><p><strong>The Entire World is a Cliché</strong></p>
				<p>Nothing’s been done before that can’t be done again in Blade. The stronger the stereotype the better, so 
				play it up. Villains always come with an army of henchmen, a secret fortress, and a nefarious plan which 
				they will boast about when they think you’re at their mercy. Old hermits always are fonts of Zen-like 
				wisdom, cynical guards are always idealists at heart, and assassins always have the soul of a poet.</p>
				
				<p>This doesn’t mean every character in your story should be a walking cliché, but you shouldn’t worry 
				about using them in your adventures either. However, don’t let your games become predictable. After all, 
				the best clichés are the ones that you put your own twist on.</p></li>
				
				<hr/>
				
				<li><p><strong>If it's Not Important, it's Off Screen</strong></p>
				<p>Some referees love to play out every situation the characters get into. That’s fine for some RPGs, but 
				not for Blade. Anything mundane, and thus uninteresting, should be dealt with quickly and without fanfare. 
				Things like eating, sleeping, and shopping should all take place off-screen. Now sometimes the weekly trip 
				to the market will be an opportunity for your PCs to get vital information, or daily meditation in the 
				shrine turns into a brawl. On these special days the mundane gets some screen time, but otherwise, forget 
				about it.</p></li>
				
				<hr/>
				
				<li><p><strong>A Game in Motion Tends to Stay in Motion</strong></p>
				<p><em>Blade</em> is a game of action, so keep the action moving. Think of your game as a movie, and then 
				think about what you do — and don’t — want to see on the screen. Stick to pulp author Raymond Chandler’s 
				school of thought: “If things come to a standstill, have a couple of armed goons kick down the door”.</p>
				
				<p>Any <em>Blade</em> setting worth gaming in is a dangerous place, and attackers out of the blue raises 
				questions that can be investigated. This doesn’t mean the game should be one continuous battle, but you 
				should keep things moving along. Don’t let your players get bogged down with trivia or become indecisive. 
				Keep the arrows flying and the blades slinging!</p></li>
				
				<hr/>
				
				<li><p><strong>It's Not <em>Just</em> About the Combat</strong></p>
				<p>A common criticism of the Sword & Sorcery genre is that it’s just about hack-and-slash. This is only 
				true if you let it be so. Like all good action novels, what happens between the fights is as important as 
				the fights themselves. High melodrama, low comedy, and complex plot twists are as much a part of Blade as 
				the action. Give your players their story! A story they really want to work through and a chance to 
				develop their character’s Passion Attributes. Endless fight scenes quickly become dull and 
				meaningless.</p></li>
				
				<hr/>
				
				<li><p><strong>Mooks - Set Dressing That's Fun to Beat Up</strong></p>
				<p>Refs new to Blade could possibly feel that unnamed characters die too easily, and ask “How can I make 
				them tougher?”. This is missing the point. Mooks aren’t supposed to be tough. Mooks, thugs, goons, and 
				Imperial Storm troopers… call them what you will, they’re meant to be cannon fodder for your PCs. Mind you, 
				this doesn’t mean that they’re harmless. Throw enough mooks at your PCs, and they’ll eventually wear them 
				down. It also doesn’t mean that mooks can’t have a few interesting powers or use clever tactics. However, 
				mooks are the extras of the game, meant to augment your main villains, not replace them.</p>
				
				<p>The real challenge should be the named characters. We would even go as far as to say that a Wound Level 
				of 4 or greater should slay a mook. Instantly! This well reflects S&S heroes clearing out a crowded hall of 
				enemies!</p>
				
				<p>By the way, don’t worry about where all these mooks come from. Villains have an endless supply of losers 
				working for them. “Crunch all you want, we’ll make more.”</p></li>
				
				<hr/>
				
				<li><p><strong>Eat Your Mooks - They're Good for You</strong></p>
				<p>To emphasize the appropriate respect, the players should have for mooks (i.e., not much), keep bowls of 
				hard candies like Reese’s Pieces or M&Ms, and use them to represent mooks. The rule is simple: If you take 
				down a mook, you get to eat him. Unless one of your players is diabetic, this is sure to get them in the 
				spirit.</p></li>
				
				<hr/>
				
				<li><p><strong>Let Your Players Shine</strong></p>
				<p>Player Characters are the heroes of your Blade novel — let them act like it. Most of what the heroes do 
				in novels or movies would never work in real life anyway, so don’t apply the “real life” rule to your 
				players. Blade characters regularly bend the laws of physics to do the things they do. Roll with it. Now 
				you shouldn’t let your players get away with things that are obviously impossible or just plain stupid. But 
				don’t trip them up with rules technicalities or reality checks.</p></li>
				
				<hr/>
				
				<li><p><strong>Let Your Players Fail</strong></p>
				<p>As a counterpoint to the above, resist the temptation to rig the game in favor of your players. Players 
				can smell a rigged game a mile away. Make them succeed on their own skills, smarts, and luck. If too much 
				attention is paid to story concerns, your Blade game may appear faithful to the original stories in form, 
				but, ironically it will not feel that way.</p>
				
				<p>The trick with presenting an uncaring Sword & Sorcery world is to referee it impartially and without 
				sentiment for the survival or well-being of the player characters. Some game theories espouse the concept 
				that PCs should be special and merit special consideration. Don’t do this. If they are to be special, it 
				should be through their own actions and by their already considerable capabilities against the hostile 
				milieu. So, no Plot or story Immunity! Blade Heroes can fail or even die — it happens in novels all the 
				time. Just be sure you give the players their shot at revenge later, and let them look good doing 
				it.</p></li>
				
				<hr/>
				
				<li><p><strong>Great Villains Never Die; They Come Back in Sequels</strong></p>
				<p>The most memorable villains keep coming back. No matter how badly they seem beaten, they always bounce 
				back with a bigger army of goons, deadlier sorcery, a more impenetrable fortress, and an even more 
				diabolical plan.</p>
				
				<p>Always give your villain a hidden escape route, or at least an ambiguous death. If your players are 
				enjoying it, they may help out with something like, “Well, that’s the last we’ll be seeing of old Thulsa. 
				After all, no one could have survived that fall.” Of course players, being the savvy (and bloodthirsty) 
				individuals that they are, will still go to great lengths to make sure your villains are truly and 
				completely dead. That’s normal, but if you think the players are getting tired of it, let the villain die. 
				He can always return as a cackling ghost if they miss him.</p></li>
				
				<hr/>
				
				<li><p><strong>Paint a Picture</strong></p>
				<p>Blade is a game that depends highly on visualization, more so than most other RPGs. The players say who 
				they are and what they’re doing; it’s up to you to provide the rest. The better your description of the 
				scene, the characters in it, and what they’re up to, the more creative your players’ acts of mayhem will be. 
				More than this, a vivid description brings the game to life, and is instrumental in introducing the Sword 
				and Sorcery feel to your players.</p></li>
				
				<hr/>
				
				<li><p><strong>Let the Players Roll the Dice</strong></p>
				<p>In large combats, players often have little control over the outcome of events when it isn’t their turn 
				in the Limelight. This can lead to boredom if a player’s attention drifts between his turns, threatening 
				to distance him from the outcome of events.</p>
				
				<p>The best method of dealing with this problem is to put more dice rolling into your players’ hands: 
				allow your players to make all of the dice rolls in and out of combat. This takes a lot of the work out 
				of the ref’s hands since he no longer needs to roll those Checks needed to administer the melee. This 
				frees up his attention for other important things, such as enemy tactics, spell effects, terrain, and the 
				like.</p>
				
				<p>Conversely, it requires the players to become much more active and aware of what’s going on. No longer 
				can players snooze through all Limelights but their own: They’ll be rolling more dice than ever before — 
				which (among other benefits) gives them the feeling of having greater control over their successes and 
				failure, plus, since the ref isn’t rolling the dice, he can’t fudge a result to give the characters a 
				break (or take one away).</p></li>
				
				<hr/>
				
				<li><p><strong>Keep Your Villains on Their Toes</strong></p>
				<p>One major consideration for an arch-villain’s organization that is often overlooked is the infighting 
				that goes on between members. Any mook’s main goal in life should be to become the next Chief Lieutenant. 
				With that in mind, they should be quite willing to sell out their fellow mooks for a chance of advancement. 
				This can often be beneficial to players who understand the value of a well-placed bribe. In turn, the 
				Chief Lieutenants should have to watch out for daggers from the shadows, and the Arch Villain himself 
				has to keep his Chief Lieutenants from becoming powerful enough to become a threat to his own schemes.</p>
				
				<p>It’s very, very dangerous to be in the Hierarchy of Evil and the road to the top is paved with 
				daggers.</p></li>
				
				<hr/>
				
				<li><p><strong>Give Your Encounter a Hook</strong></p>
				<p>Call it what you will, but by ‘hook’ I’m talking about giving your Blade encounter that unusual element 
				which will spark an immediate interest in your players. If the players get interested, you can often feed 
				off of that and become energized to referee a great encounter. A hook is that special something that makes 
				the encounter strange, new, exciting, puzzling or provoking:</p>
				
				<ul>
					<li>A fascinating location (on a narrow, crumbling bridge; above a massive spinning fan; in the 
					roaring, pounding surf)</li>
					
					<li>It could assail one of the senses (strobing light caused by strange fungi, intense heat from a 
					blazing fire, strange noises, weird lights, sudden temperature changes)</li>
				</ul>
				
				</li>
				
				<hr/>
				
				<li><p><strong>Give Your Players Small Secrets</strong></p>
				<p>Play with plenty of small secrets in your Blade game. Why does the prim and proper lady down the street 
				go out every Thursday at midnight and not return until noon the next day? What’s that blue flickering 
				light that shines from a neighbor’s basement window at night? Why can’t you remember last Tuesday morning, 
				anyway? The “best” and most inspiring RPG material I’ve seen is always material that contains dozens of 
				tiny, throw-away mysteries. Almost every paragraph mentions some weird oddity and doesn’t really explain 
				it. These are small things, not secrets that will change the nature of the universe. In addition, they 
				give the players who can’t solve mysteries to save their own lives something to play with.</p>
				
				<p>Small mysteries tend to be much easier to solve: You follow the prim and proper lady. You sneak into 
				your neighbor’s basement. You ask people around your neighborhood whether they saw where you went last 
				Tuesday morning. Not all mysteries involve webs of clues and payoffs. Even someone who swears up and down 
				that they hate mysteries may find some fun in hunting down the easy answer to a small question. You’re no 
				longer stuck with a choice between leaving mysteries out entirely or alienating one of your players. Have 
				Fun!</p></li>

			<p class="h4" id="P_TheIronRule">Final Word : The Iron Rule</p>
			<p>These rules are yours, and you are invited to make them even more so by customising them to your heart’s 
			content. Add, change, and ignore what you like. There is however only a single rule that cannot be altered 
			while still playing Blade and this is the Iron Rule: When we encourage “you” to make these rules your own we 
			are referring to the gaming group, not the referee. The gaming group has every authority to change the rules; 
			the ref on his own has none. He doesn’t own the game he is refereeing, the group does. If he wants to change 
			a rule, ignore a rule, or add a rule, he has to run this by his group, and if the majority of the group 
			(himself included as but one member among several members of equal rights) repudiates this change, the change 
			cannot be enacted.</p>
			
			<p>The ref has but one special authority over the rules: He can veto any rules change proposed by any of the 
			players. It doesn’t matter if the majority of the group wants to change one of the rules presented herein, if 
			the ref isn’t comfortable with such a change, the rule still stands. So that’s the Rule of Iron. The group as 
			a whole may change the rules as it likes, the ref without the group’s consent may not.</p>
