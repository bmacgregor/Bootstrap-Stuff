			<p class="h2">Animals in Combat</p>
			<p>In <em>Blade</em>, common animals of the wild are, after men, the second most common combat adversaries of 
			PCs, and much more common opponents than monsters or supernatural critters. Referees are therefore advised to 
			somewhat ignore the actual behaviour of real-world animals.</p>
			
			<p>The latter have learned to fear man and usually only attack him under exceptional circumstances, and then 
			as a last resort. The world of Sword & Sorcery being the ferocious place that it is, it is therefore absolutely 
			appropriate to reduce this natural fear. Here, man may very well not be simply prey of the very last resort 
			for packs of wolves, bears, tigers, and other predators, but may actually be well within their normal range 
			of prey.</p>
			
			<p>Still, while wild animals of the Sword & Sorcery genre are often more aggressive, they should not be 
			portrayed as universally rabid. In most cases they should not be portrayed as fighting to the death. A single 
			level 3 wound should be enough to drive off most animals, unless they are for some reason truly desperate.</p>
		</div>

			<p class="h4">Animals in Combat Overview</p>
			<p>In targeting animals with attacks, the human Target Zone template will usually not be appropriate. In many 
			cases, common sense may better serve instead of a template – hits to birds and snakes can for example be 
			allocated quite easily. For quadrupeds of all sizes, a separate target location template is however 
			provided.</p>
			
			<p>No separate Wound Tables for animals are provided. Instead, just use the human ones and interpret the 
			results with a bit of common sense.</p>
			
			<p>KD against quadrupeds is the one wound result that usually needs modification. As long as all four legs of 
			a quadruped are functioning without great impairment (i.e. no wound greater than level 3 to any leg), KD 
			success requirements for any wound received is reduced by 2.</p>
			
			<p>If one leg is already impaired, KD is applied normally, and if two legs should already be impaired, and the 
			animal is still aggressive, KD success requirements are increased by 2.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_LargeAnimals">Large Animals and Wounds</p>
			<p>Wounds to animals are calculated exactly like wounds against humans, but for large animals that are much 
			more massive, this may yield odd results. For those animals, final Wound Levels suffered after subtraction of 
			half BN and Armor Value should be halved.</p>
			
			<div class="panel-body bg-warning" id="DIV_Example_LargeAnimals">
				<p><em><strong>Example</strong>: The wound result of a large Grizzly bear’s level 5 wound would be further 
				reduced to a level 3 wound (5 divided by 2 = 2.5 which then rounds up to 3). As a rule of the thumb, this 
				applies to wounds to the torso (not head and limbs) to all animals larger than a pony, and for all wounds 
				(including both head and limbs) to any animal the size of a rhinoceros or larger. As an optional rule for 
				those who want added realism (and added complication), all Piercing damage that would simply be halved due 
				to a target animal’s large size is increased by +1 before being halved.</em></p>
			</div>
			
			<br/>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_HugeAnimals">Huge Animals</p>
			<p>Even though such creatures are rarely encountered in Sword & Sorcery, some refs might want to utilize truly 
			huge creatures as opponents for their PCs. A creature that is at the very least as big as a rhinoceros may 
			engage more than one PC at once, provided its build does logically allow for this. A giant octopus creature 
			might for example engage several PCs simultaneously, as might a tyrannosaur, biting one and kicking another 
			opponent, but a giant wolf, lacking multiple modes of attack, might not. A creature able to engage more than 
			one PC at once can within one and the same Round of Limelights act upon more than just one PC’s Limelight. 
			During how many PCs’ Limelight it could act, and how many PCs it could thus engage, will have to be adjudicated 
			by the ref on basis of the creature’s size and physical shape.</p>
			
			<p>The creature need not split its MP between the Limelights, but gets its full MP against every PC. However, 
			the MP is reduced by 2 dice for every PC after the first the creature engages. This penalty does not become 
			bigger by 2 for every additional PC’s Limelight during which the creature acts, but is applied to its MP for 
			all Limelights equally.</p>
			
			<div class="panel-body bg-warning" id="DIV_Example_HugeAnimals">
				<p><em><strong>Example</strong>: Otho and Rufo are fighting a gargantuan crab-demon huge enough to act on 
				both the PCs’ Limelights, attacking each of them with one of its pincers. The demon’s MP is 15, but this 
				is reduced by 2 for fighting a second PC; its effective MP against both Otho and Rufo is 13.</em></p>
			</div>
			
			<br/>
			
			<p>If the discontinuity between a huge creatures’ various combats in any given Round of Limelights and the 
			lack of cooperation among its opponents worries a group, the following optional rule may be used:</p>
			
			<p>The huge creature’s MP for any given Limelight is penalized by the sum of the total Wound Levels it has 
			suffered previously during the same Round of Limelights. This is a slight violation of the basic principle 
			that the Limelights of any given Round of Limelights occur at the same time, but simulates how one character’s 
			efforts in fighting a huge animal carry over to dramatically aid his comrades’ efforts. If this optional rule 
			is being used, the huge creature’s MP is not reduced by 2 dice per opponent after the first, but by only 1 
			die per such opponent.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_FightingAnimals">Fighting Animals</p>
			<p>Animals do not use the normal Offensive and Defensive Maneuvers of humans, but their own take on some of 
			them, or Maneuvers entirely exclusive to them. By and large, animals that enter combat at all fight very 
			aggressively, using the better part of their MP for offence. The single defensive action they have at their 
			disposal is Evasion, though they do tend to make quite liberal use of the Evasive Attack Offensive 
			Maneuver.</p>
			
			<p class="h3">Animal Maneuvers</p>
			<p class="h4" id="P_ATK_Bash">Bash</p>
			<p>Most kicks by hooved animals are handled by the Bash Maneuver, but it may also be used for powerful tail 
			swipes or for example for a hit by an elephant’s trunk. The Bash may also be used by horned animals to butt 
			opponents with their horns, for either Blunt, or, more rarely, Piercing damage, depending on the beast in 
			question.</p>
			
			<p>This type of attack carries an additional 1 MP Activation Cost (i.e. 1, or 2 in case of an attack causing 
			+1 damage). Note that the option of spending 1 MP to increase the attack’s Damage Rating by +1 is not available 
			if the attack causes Piercing damage.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_ATK_Bite">Bite</p>
			<p>A simple bite, with most damage being Cleaving. Metal armor offers very good protection against bites.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_ATK_Claw">Claw</p>
			<p>A swipe with claws usually inflicts Blunt damage with some additional Blood Loss, but may with some rare 
			animal’s long talons inflict Cleaving damage instead. Metal armor protects very well against animal clawing 
			attacks.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_ATK_Constricting">Constricting</p>
			<p>Some animals kill their prey through constricting them. Prime examples are of course the many forms of large 
			snakes, but this form of attack may, at the referee’s discretion, also be available to bears, if he desires to 
			include the (in)famous bear hug attack in his game. To use the Constricting Maneuver, the beast must first have 
			made a successful grapple attack on an opponent, though a bite attack may be substituted for animals like 
			snakes that can establish the initial hold by biting.</p>
			
			<p>Once the hold is established by the use of the Grapple (or Bite) Maneuver, the animal may attack by use of a 
			Constricting Maneuver each Round, free of Activation Cost. MP dice are assigned for the attack, and the 
			constricted opponent assigns any number of MP dice for the defense (remember that a grappled opponent must use 
			his Wrestling Proficiency to calculate his MP). Both parties roll against TN 7.</p>
			
			<p>If the defender is victorious, he breaks free of the constriction and normal melee combat resumes at Reach 
			Hand, with the victorious defender now having initiative as aggressor. If the attacker ties or is victorious, 
			he inflicts Blunt damage on his opponent. The amount of damage inflicted is calculated without use of QoS or 
			Armor Value simply by subtracting half the defender’s BN from half the attacker’s BN, with cumulative +1 added 
			for every subsequent Round of constriction. The Wound Level inflicted may however not surpass the constrictor’s 
			QoS. The location of this Blunt damage depends on the circumstances. With snakes, it will usually be to the 
			lower abdomen or the legs, with a bear hug to the chest.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_ATK_EvasiveAttack">Evasive Attack</p>
			<p>This Offensive Maneuver is used quite extensively by animals. It functions exactly as for humans, ex. the 
			animal spends the Activation Cost of 1 MP die, and additional dice as desired. The enemy’s Attack Target Number 
			is increased by the number of additional dice thus spent, whereas the animal’s own Attack Target Number is only 
			increased by half the number of the additional dice.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_ATK_Grapple">Grapple</p>
			<p>Animals do use the Grapple Offensive Maneuver, but what they do with a grappled opponent is different from 
			what humans may choose to do. A beast may not choose to immobilize a grappled opponent, but it may attempt to 
			throw him to the ground or to break the grappled limb. In addition, certain types of animal have other options 
			as well: Snakes may attempt to crush the opponent to death, felines may rake him with their hind claws, and 
			canines may worry him with their powerful jaws. Details can be found under the respective Maneuvers.</p>
			
			<p>Beasts that can either use the Constricting, Raking, Pouncing, or Worrying Maneuver may use a successful 
			bite attack to enter a clinch. They can do this by attacking normally with the Bite Maneuver and simply 
			declaring after a successful hit, even one causing no wound, that they won’t let go. This immediately 
			establishes a clinch, though one in which the animal does not receive the establishing attack’s QoS as bonus 
			dice on its subsequent MP, as would be the case with a clinch entered by use of the Grapple Maneuver.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_ATK_Pouncing">Pouncing</p>
			<p>Some animals such as tigers are quite proficient at surprising a victim by leaping upon them, using their 
			considerable mass coupled with speed of impact to stun their prey. This gives the Pouncing animal a decided 
			advantage in the Bite Maneuver that inevitably follows. All dice assigned to Pouncing are checked against TN 
			7 and can be defended against by only by Evasion (target must probably first pass a Surprise Check to be aware 
			of the Pouncing animal and evade it).</p>
			
			<p>If the Pouncing attacker is victorious, he inflicts Blunt damage on his opponent. The amount of damage 
			inflicted is calculated without use of QoS or Armor Value simply by subtracting half the defender’s BN from 
			half the attacker’s BN. Should the attacker be considerably heavier than the defender (more than twice as 
			heavy), +1 is added to this damage; if the attacker is considerably lighter (less than half as massive), -1 
			is subtracted. The Wound Level inflicted may however not surpass the Pouncing animal’s QoS.</p>
			
			<p>The location of this Blunt damage depends on the circumstances. With tigers for example, it will usually 
			be to the Shoulders, Chest, Ribs, or Abs areas. A successful Pounce attack also requires the opponent to pass 
			a Knockdown Check with a Challenge Level equal to the Pouncing attacker’s QoS. If the Pounce is successfully 
			defended against (i.e. evaded) in such a way that initiative passes to the defender, the melee continues with 
			Reach now set at Hand, and the defender as the new aggressor.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_ATK_Raking">Raking</p>
			<p>Felines are especially fond of this Offensive Maneuver, one that can be considered an option of the Grapple 
			Maneuver available to them. Any time the animal is in a clinch with its opponent, whether this clinch was 
			established by use of the Grapple or the Bite Maneuver, it may pay an Activation Cost of 1 MP and attack with 
			its hind claws. Such an attack does not in itself break the clinch.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_ATK_Stampede">Stampede</p>
			<p>Certain animals (such as bulls) are able to attack opponents by charging and running right over them. This 
			requires a run up and the expenditure of 1 MP Activation Cost and can only be defended against by Evasion. The 
			attack is rolled against TN 7, and inflicts Blunt damage with Damage Rating 0, or Damage Rating +1 if the 
			beast has substantial horns. KD from this attack is increased by +1 to a minimum of 1, and the Check to avoid 
			KD is not made against the standard TN 7, but against 6 + QoS on the attack roll. If the stampede is 
			successfully defended against (i.e. evaded) in such a way that initiative passes to the defender, the follow-up 
			attack of the new aggressor is made at +1 Attack Target Number. This is due to the stampeding animal’s speed 
			carrying it quickly out of range of any attack.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_ATK_Swooping">Swooping</p>
			<p>Swooping is the favourite attack of birds and other, sometimes larger, airborne attackers. Essentially, 
			it’s a fly-by claw attack. To initiate the Maneuver, the avian aggressor announces a Swoop. His opponent then 
			declares any number of dice from his MP to prolong the contact with the avian, who then sets aside a number 
			of dice from his MP in opposition. Those dice are rolled in an Opposed Terrain Check. If the Swoop’s victim 
			is victorious, the Combat Round does have the usual two Exchanges, if the result is a tie or a victory for the 
			avian it is limited to a single Exchange.</p>
			
			<p>Whether the avian is successful on Swooping or not, it now has initiative as aggressor at its optimum 
			engagement Reach. An opponent conscious of the attack may of course attempt to Steal Initiative or simply 
			declare as aggressor as well, in which case his attack will only be resolved after the Swooping attack and at 
			the avian’s Reach.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_ATK_TakeDown">Take Down</p>
			<p>Some animals are especially adept at bringing an opponent down to their level, either by launching their 
			mass at him, or by attacking his legs, or by cunningly unbalancing him. The dice assigned to the Take Down 
			Maneuver are checked against TN 7 and can be defended against by Blocking or Evasion, but not by Parrying.</p>
			
			<p>A successful Take Down attack causes no damage, but requires the opponent to pass a Knockdown Check with a 
			Challenge Level equal to the Take Down’s QoS. Animal that are used to working as a team, like packs of 
			canines, may combine forces to Take Down an opponent. Knockdown Checks must be made against every individual 
			Take Down, but for every previous such Knockdown Check passed in one and the same Exchange, the Challenge 
			Level of the Knockdown Checks against Take Down is increased by +1.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_ATK_Worrying">Worrying</p>
			<p>Certain beasts, particularly canines and certain large felines, have extremely strong jaws. Once such an 
			animal has made a successful bite attack on an opponent, it may choose to hold on, thereby entering a clinch, 
			and to “Worry” the attack (meaning that it locks its teeth and shakes its head).</p>
			
			<p>On the exchange following a successful bite attack, the animal may assign any number of dice to the Worrying 
			Maneuver. The opponent may assign dice from his MP, but as he is now in a clinch, his MP is based upon his 
			Wrestling Proficiency. Should the bitten opponent wish to go on attacking the animal, he is allowed to use his 
			weapon MP instead, but in this case may not assign more dice to resisting the Worrying than the value of his 
			Reflex score (plus any PA dice figuring in the MP).</p>
			
			<p>Both opponents roll against TN 7. If the worrying animal is victorious, the wound inflicted by the previous 
			bite becomes aggravated by one Wound Level, with all attending penalties, including Pain, BL, and KD, but 
			excluding Shock and KO. The animal may choose to hold on and continue with the Worrying Maneuver, or it may 
			let go. If the Check is tied, the wound does not become worse, but the animal may choose to let go or hold on 
			as above.</p>
			
			<p>If the defender is victorious, he breaks free and the melee continues with Reach now set at Hand, and with 
			him as the new aggressor. The victim of a Worrying may attempt to attack the animal with the part of the MP he 
			does not set aside for resisting the Worrying, after the Worrying attack has been resolved. Such an attack is 
			made at Reach Hand and carries an additional Activation Cost equal to half the animal’s QoS on the Worrying 
			Check, plus the usual Activation Cost for declaring an attack as defender (i.e. half the aggressor’s DG score). 
			If this Activation Cost reduces his MP to 0 or below, he may not attack.</p>
			
			<p>While holding on to the prey, the worrying animal can defend only by use of Duck & Weave. Whether it is hit 
			or not, the animal will retain initiative as aggressor and will not be forced to let go, though may of course 
			choose to do so. Apart from possibly killing the beast or wounding it seriously enough to drive it off, the use 
			of attacking and wounding a worrying beast lies in the dice it will lose from it MP for the next Worrying 
			attack.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_PackTactics">Pack Tactics</p>
			<p>Many animals naturally tend to form communities. Very strong ties are often formed especially in the case 
			of canines (including wolves, hyenas, jackals and the like) and some wild cats (tigers and leopards, 
			especially). Such animals are highly effective at working together to bring down foes. If a pack or team of 
			animals is fought, and the number of combatants on both sides are roughly equal, the combat is handled as 
			usual, but if the animals clearly outnumber their opponents, the rules below should be used. In such cases, 
			predators, who are very cunning at evaluating prey, will always concentrate their surplus number on the 
			weakest victim, while more dangerous ones will simply be kept in check by a single animal each.</p>
			
			<p>These single beasts will not expose themselves by fighting offensively, but will merely attempt to stall 
			their opponent until their comrades bring down the weaker prey.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_PACK_Baiting">Baiting</p>
			<p>This is a form of feint used by a group of animals working together closely. The beast using the Baiting 
			Maneuver pays an Activation Cost of 1 die, but declares another Offensive Maneuver. Once the defender has 
			assigned dice to the defence, the Baiting Maneuver is revealed for what it is. The baiting beast may now add 
			any number of dice to the attack, at an additional Activation Cost equal to half the number of dice added. 
			The initially declared Offensive Maneuver is then rolled and defended against as usual.</p>
			
			<p>If the defender wins the Opposed Check, he takes initiative as normal. If the aggressor ties or wins, no 
			damage is dealt, as the entire attack was only a ruse to draw out the defender. Instead, the defender loses 
			dice equal to the aggressor’s QoS from his MP for either the following Exchange, or the following Round if the 
			current Exchange was this Round’s last one.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_PACK_Swarming">Swarming</p>
			<p>Animals fighting in packs are extremely good at surrounding an opponent, and attacking him from different 
			sides at the same time. Up to four medium sized animals (such as wolves) may attack an opponent, rather than 
			the usual limit of three.</p>
