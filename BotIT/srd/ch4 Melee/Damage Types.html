			<p class="h2">Damage Types</p>
			<p>Melee and missile weapons deal one of three wound types: Cleaving, Piercing, or Blunt wounds.</p>
			
			<p>Cleaving wounds are the most common form of wound delivered in a fight.</p>
			
			<p>Piercing wounds, wounds caused by spear and sword thrusts, incoming arrows, and the like, do their work 
			internally, and are in many ways deadlier that sword cuts. They normally use the thrust Target Zones 
			(11-14).</p>
			
			<p>Blunt wounds, those caused by maces, clubs, quarterstaffs, pommels and the like, including bare fists, can 
			be deadly. The impact of such strikes can cause large amounts of Shock (see below), which often necessitates 
			difficult Knockdown Checks.</p>
		</div>
	</div>

	<div class="container text-justify">
		<div>
			<p class="h4">Damage Types Described</p>
			<p>Bleeding from Piercing wounds is usually much harder to control as such wounds are typically located deep 
			within the victim’s body.</p>
			
			<p>Blunt attacks are effective against many types of armor, as much of a blow’s force will transmit through 
			armour without the need to penetrate, causing the wearer substantial blunt trauma. Blunt attacks are usually 
			swung (areas 1 – 7), but some, including those delivered from fists, may be executed with a straight thrust 
			(areas 8-14).</p>

			<p>For all other forms of damage there is a “Generic Damage Table” (see Appendix).</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p>Shock and Pain are both metrics indicating how badly any wound affects a combatant’s ability to persevere 
			and continue fighting. Each wound descriptor contains an individual rating for both.</p>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_Shock">Shock</p>
			<p>Shock is only applied once for each wound, but deducts dice from all three dice pools (Melee, Archery, and 
			Sorcery) the moment the character is struck by the blow. If the received Shock exceeds a character’s total 
			current MP for his very next action, the remaining of the Shock penalty is instead <strong>added to the 
			aggressor’s MP</strong> for the next Combat Round, or Exchange, if the current Exchange is the ongoing Combat 
			Round’s first one. Such bonus dice are of course only usable against the “Shocked” opponent.</p>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_Pain">Pain</p>
			<p>Pain is deducted from one’s MP (and Archery Pool and SP) at the beginning of each Combat Round, starting 
			with the one following the Combat Round in which Shock from the wound was applied. While Shock is a fixed 
			number, Pain is reduced by one’s TY. For the purposes of wound healing, where Pain is important, record the 
			unreduced Pain rating of every wound, but apply only Pain in excess of the character’s TY as penalty to his 
			pools.</p>
			
			<p>TY is thus applied in full to Pain with every single wound; it is not correct to total up Pain from several 
			wounds and only then apply TY, but rather to apply TY to every single wound and then add up the reduced Pain 
			ratings to determine the penalty to dice pools.</p>
			
			<p>In addition to the die penalty to one’s applicable pool from Blood Loss (BL), described next, a Pain 
			component is also added to a roll when tasked with a Skill or Attribute Check for any activity requiring 
			fast, controlled movement, such as riding at a gallop, running, climbing, jumping, or other similar tasks.</p>
			
			<p>Such residual Pain is mechanically expressed as one additional Success needed for every 4 full points of 
			dice pool penalty from Pain. If the roll does not yield the required additional net Successes, the attempted 
			Skill or Attribute Check has failed. Of course, if the character is, after TY has been applied to every wound, 
			currently carrying less than 4 cumulative points of Pain, no additional Successes are required and the normal 
			needed amount of Successes will suffice.</p>
			
			<div class="panel-body bg-warning" id="DIV_Example_Pain">
				<p><em><strong>Example</strong>: Otho is at Pain 4 while plodding along the King’s Highway on horseback. 
				Brigands suddenly burst howling onto the roadway behind him in hot pursuit and Otho kicks his mount into 
				a gallop! The ref asks Otho’s player to make a Riding Skill Check yielding at least 1 additional Success 
				in order to both cope with his Pain, and stay in the saddle. He rolls 2 Successes and therefore is able 
				to keep his seat when his horse explodes into a gallop, gritting his teeth against the pain.</em></p>
			</div>
			
			<br/>
			
			<p>Pain is also important in figuring out healing times, as described in Chapter Five.</p>
			
			<p>Shock and Pain are cumulative as long as they are applied to different zones. Should one attack the same 
			area multiple times, the highest shock penalty—new or old—is applied (or re-applied) to the wounded party. It 
			can thus be beneficial to attack a well-wounded area again and again, even with weak attacks—the original 
			shock penalty will keep on returning to haunt the wounded!</p>
			
			<p>When recording wounds on your character sheet, make a note of where the exact wound is and what effects it 
			may have, such as Shock, Pain, or BL. Such shorthand as “Wound Level 3, cut, 6/4 left,” meaning “A level three 
			Cleaving wound at zone 6, section 4(from the d6 roll), on the left side, can be useful when recording wounds 
			on your character sheet. Make sure to record each individual wound’s Pain rating as well.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_BloodLoss">Blood Loss</p>
			<p>Blood Loss covers the deterioration of one’s body due to bleeding, the most dangerous of which is the 
			internal kind. Some wounds, especially of the Piercing and Cleaving type, carry a Blood Loss value along with 
			any Shock and Pain ratings.</p>
			
			<p>The Blood Loss ratings of all wounds sustained are cumulative – as long as they come from different parts 
			of the body, with each limb, the entire torso and the head each counting as one large location. If such a 
			body part already sports a wound with an attendant BL, and is wounded again in a way to indicate BL, only 
			the higher of the two Blood Loss ratings is in effect.  At the very end of the Limelight in which the 
			character first acquired Blood Loss, and on the end of each subsequent Limelight, he must check BN. This 
			Check must yield Successes equal to or surpassing the current Blood Loss number. If it doesn’t, the character 
			suffers a penalty of 2 dice on his MP, Archery Pool and SP. In addition, his Attribute and Skill Checks will 
			need 1 additional Success per full 4 dice penalty to MP, Archery Pool and SP. The BN Check to avoid further 
			Blood Loss is exempt from this requirement for additional Successes. These penalties represent dizziness or 
			weakness from loss of blood, and accumulate from failed BN Check to failed BN Check.</p>
			
			<p>Once accumulated penalties from failed Blood Loss Checks equal or exceed the character’s BN, the character 
			passes out from blood loss and will likely die without quick medical attention. Thereafter, a Blood Loss Check 
			is made for the unconscious character at the end of each subsequent Round of Limelights, and if any Check 
			fails, the character has bled to death. Please note that Blood Loss Checks made while the bleeding character 
			is at rest (no more strenuous activity than walking very slowly) require one less Success than indicated by 
			the current Blood Loss rating to be successful. This includes characters’ unconscious from BL.</p>
			
			<p>Blood Loss ratings, unless from internal damage, are quite easily removed by the most elemental use of 
			first aid; for details, see Chapter Five. However, even if a character’s Blood Loss rating is reduced to 0; 
			those penalties accrued due to Blood Loss will not diminish immediately. Such penalties are reduced by 2 for 
			MP, Archery Pool and SP for each passing day spent resting with proper nourishment and low activity, or by 1 
			per passing day of exertion.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_Knockdown">Knockdown</p>
			<p>Knockdown (KD) can be the result of some wounds, especially but not exclusively those to the legs. With 
			such wounds, the wound description will include a KD number, denoting the number of Successes needed on a 
			Check of the Knockdown Attribute to avoid falling prone. A KD Check is also necessitated each time a 
			character’s remaining MP for the Round is reduced to 0 or less from a wound received. The Challenge Rating of 
			this Check will be set at Challenging if the character’s MP is reduced to below –5, or simply Average in 
			other cases. If the wound which caused the initial Shock reduced MP to 0 or below, and calls for a Check by 
			itself, only the more difficult of the two Checks need be made, but the Challenge Rating of the Check is 
			increased by 1.</p>
			
			<p>Optionally, if a group wants an additional layer of realism, every hit to the knee or below that fails to 
			cause a wound instead generates a KD Check. The Challenge Level of this Check is Average if the hit was from a 
			thrust-based attack or one-handed swing, Challenging if from a two-handed swing or a one-handed swing with a 
			mass weapon, and Difficult if from a two-handed swing with a mass weapon or pole-arm. However, the required 
			number of Successes may never be greater than the QoS on the attack roll; light blows to the legs don’t 
			stagger many, even if from very massive weapons.</p>
			
			<p>Equally optional, any hit at the elbow or below to the weapon arm of somebody wielding a weapon in one hand 
			also necessitates a KD of the same Challenge Level as above, failure resulting in the weapon being dropped.</p>
			
			<p>A knocked down character is at half MP while fighting from the ground. This MP is halved after all other 
			modifiers due to Pain etc. have been applied. If he is knocked down during an ongoing Combat Round, he 
			immediately loses a number of dice from his MP equal to the difference between his MP at the beginning of the 
			Round and half that number.</p>
			
			<div class="panel-body bg-warning" id="DIV_Example_Knockdown">
				<p><em><strong>Example</strong>: Togrul begins a Round with MP 13. If he is knocked down during this Round, 
				he immediately loses 6 dice from his MP (the difference between MP 13 and MP 7). Provided nothing else 
				deducts from his MP, he refreshes to MP 7 at the beginning of the next Round.</p>
				
				<p>To get back on his feet while fighting an opponent, he must win a defense Check in a way that would 
				otherwise enable him to assume the role of aggressor. He may in this case choose between either remaining 
				the defender but getting back to his feet, or becoming the aggressor but remaining on the ground.</em></p>
			</div>
			
			<br/>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_Knockout">Knockout</p>
			<p>Knockout (KO) can be a consequence of blows to the head. If the description of a wound contains a KO 
			number, this is the Challenge Level the wounded character needs to pass on an immediate Check of his Knockout 
			Attribute. Failure on this check indicates unconsciousness. Optionally, any blow to the head that fails to 
			cause a wound will still call for a KO Check nonetheless, unless the hit was received from a thrust 
			Piercing or thrust Cleaving attack.</p>
			
			<p>The Challenge Level of this Check is Average if a swung Piercing attack, Challenging if a swung Cleaving or 
			thrusting Blunt attack, and Difficult if a swung Blunt attack, but may be under no circumstances higher than 
			half the attack’s QoS.</p>
