			<p class="h2">Damage Types</p>
			<p>Melee and missile weapons deal one of three wound types: Cleaving, Piercing, or Blunt wounds.</p>
			
			<p>Cleaving wounds are the most common form of wound delivered in a fight.</p>
			
			<p>Piercing wounds caused by spear and sword thrusts, incoming arrows, and the like, do their work internally, 
			and are in many ways deadlier that sword cuts. They normally use the thrust Target Zones (11-14).</p>
			
			<p>Blunt wounds are caused by maces, clubs, quarterstaffs, pommels and the like, including bare fists, can 
			be deadly. The impact of such strikes can cause large amounts of Shock (see below), which often necessitates 
			difficult Knockdown Checks.</p>
		</div>
	</div>

	<div class="container text-justify">
		<div class="panel-body">
			<p class="h4">Damage Types Described</p>
			<p>Bleeding from Piercing wounds is usually much harder to control as such wounds are typically located deep 
			within the victim’s body.</p>
			
			<p>Blunt attacks are effective against many types of armour, as much of a blow’s force will transmit through 
			armour without the need to penetrate, causing the wearer substantial blunt trauma. Blunt attacks are usually 
			swung (areas 1 – 7), but some, including those delivered from fists, may be executed with a straight thrust 
			(areas 8-14).</p>

			<p>For all other forms of damage there is a Generic Damage Table, which can be found in the Appendix.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p>Shock and Pain are both metrics indicating how badly any wound affects a combatant’s ability to persevere 
			and keep fighting. Each wound descriptor contains an individual rating for both.</p>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_Shock">Shock</p>
			<p>Shock is only applied once for each wound, but deducts dice from all three dice pools (Melee, Archery, and 
			Sorcery) <strong>the moment the character is struck by the blow</strong>. If the received Shock exceeds a 
			Character’s total current Melee Pool for his very next action, the remaining of the Shock penalty is instead 
			<strong>added to the aggressor’s Melee Pool</strong> for the next Combat Round or Exchange, if the current 
			Exchange is the ongoing Combat Round’s first one. Such bonus dice are of course only usable against the Shocked 
			opponent.</p>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_Pain">Pain</p>
			<p>Pain is deducted from each of the three pools at the beginning of each Combat Round, starting with the one 
			<em>following</em> the Combat Round in which Shock from the wound was applied. While Shock is a fixed 
			number, Pain is reduced by one’s Tenacity. For the purposes of wound healing, where Pain is important, record 
			the unreduced Pain rating of every wound, but apply only Pain in excess of the character’s Tenacity as a 
			penalty to her pools.</p>
			
			<p>Tenacity is applied in full to Pain with every single wound; do not total up Pain from several wounds first 
			and then apply the Tenacity score. Instead, <strong>apply Tenacity to every <em>single</em> wound</strong> and 
			<em>then</em> add up the reduced Pain ratings to determine the penalty to die pools.</p>
			
			<p>In addition to the die penalty to one’s applicable pool from Blood Loss (BL), described next, a Pain 
			component is also added to a roll when tasked with a Skill or Attribute Check for any activity requiring 
			fast, controlled movement, such as riding at a gallop, running, climbing, jumping, or other similar tasks.</p>
			
			<p>Such residual Pain is mechanically expressed as one additional Success needed for every four dice removed by 
			Pain. If the roll does not yield the required additional net Successes, the attempted Skill or Attribute Check 
			has failed. Of course, if the Character is suffering from <em>less than</em> four cumulative points of Pain, no 
			additional Successes are required, and the normal amount of Successes will suffice for Checks.</p>
			
			<div class="panel-body bg-warning" id="DIV_Example_Pain">
				<p><em><strong>Example</strong>: Otho is at Pain four while plodding along the King’s Highway on horseback. 
				Brigands suddenly burst onto the roadway behind him in hot pursuit; Otho kicks his mount into a gallop! The 
				Game Master asks Otho’s Player to make a Riding Skill Check, needing at least one additional Success in 
				order to cope with his Pain and stay in the saddle. He rolls two Successes, and is able to keep his seat 
				when his horse explodes into a gallop, gritting his teeth against the pain.</em></p>
			</div>
			
			<br/>
			
			<p>Pain is also important in figuring out healing times, as described in Chapter Five.</p>
			
			<p>Shock and Pain are cumulative as long as they are applied to <em>different zones</em>. Should one attack the 
			same area multiple times, the highest shock penalty — new or old — is applied (or re-applied) to the wounded 
			party. Because of this, it can be beneficial to attack a wounded area again and again, even with weak attacks — 
			the original shock penalty will keep on returning to haunt the wounded!</p>
			
			<p>When recording wounds on your Character sheet, make a note of where the exact wound is and what effects it 
			may have, such as Shock, Pain, or Blood Loss. Such shorthand as “Wound Level 3, cut, 6/4 left,” meaning “A 
			level three Cleaving wound at zone 6, section 4 (from the d6 roll), on the left side". Make sure to record each 
			individual wound’s Pain, Shock, and Blood Loss ratings as well.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_BloodLoss">Blood Loss</p>
			<p>Blood Loss covers the deterioration of one’s body due to bleeding, the most dangerous of which is the 
			internal kind. Some wounds, especially of the Piercing and Cleaving type, carry a Blood Loss value along with 
			Shock and Pain ratings.</p>
			
			<p>The Blood Loss ratings of all wounds sustained are cumulative, provided they come from different parts 
			of the body, with each limb, the entire torso and the head each counting as one large location. If a body part 
			already sports a wound with an attendant Blood Loss rating and is wounded again in a way to indicate further 
			Blood Loss, only the higher of the two ratings comes (or stays) in effect.  At the very end of the Limelight in 
			which the Character first acquired Blood Loss, and on the end of each subsequent Limelight, she must check 
			Brawn. This Check must yield Successes equal to or surpassing the current Blood Loss number. If it doesn’t, the 
			Character suffers a two die penalty to her Melee, Archery, and Spell Pools. In addition, her Attribute and 
			Skill Checks will need an additional Success per full four dice penalty. The Brawn Check to avoid further Blood 
			Loss is exempt from this requirement for additional Successes. These penalties represent dizziness or weakness 
			from loss of blood, and accumulate from failed Brawn Check to failed Brawn Check.</p>
			
			<p>Once accumulated penalties from failed Blood Loss Checks equal or exceed the character’s Brawn, the Character 
			passes out from blood loss, and will likely die without quick medical attention. Thereafter, a Blood Loss Check 
			is made for the unconscious Character at the end of each subsequent Round of Limelights. If any Check fails, 
			the Character has bled to death. Please note that Blood Loss Checks made while the bleeding Character is at 
			rest (no more strenuous activity than walking very slowly) require one less Success than indicated by the 
			current Blood Loss rating to be successful. This includes Characters’ unconscious from Blood Loss.</p>
			
			<p>Blood Loss ratings, unless from internal damage, are easily removed by the most elemental use of first aid 
			(for details on healing, see Chapter Five), however, even if a Character’s Blood Loss rating is reduced to zero, 
			those penalties accrued due to Blood Loss will not diminish immediately. Such penalties are reduced by two for 
			each die Pool for each passing day spent resting with proper nourishment and low activity, or by one per 
			passing day of exertion.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_Knockdown">Knockdown</p>
			<p>Knockdown can be the result of some wounds, especially (but not exclusively) those to the legs. With such 
			wounds, the description will include a Knockdown number which denotes the number of Successes needed on a 
			Knockdown Check to avoid falling prone. <strong>A Knockdown Check is also necessitated each time a Character’s 
			remaining Melee Pool for the Round is reduced to zero or less from a wound received</strong>. The Challenge 
			Rating of this Check will be set at Challenging (two successes) if the character’s Melee Pool is reduced to 
			below –5, or simply Average (one success) in other cases. If the wound which caused the initial Shock reduced 
			the Melee Pool to zero or below and also calls for a Check, only the more difficult of the two Checks need be 
			made, but the Challenge Rating of the Check is <em>increased by 1.</em></p>
			
			<p>Optionally, if a group wants an additional layer of realism, every hit to the knee or below that fails to 
			cause a wound instead generates a Knockdown Check. The Challenge Level of this Check is Average (one success) 
			if the hit was from a thrust-based attack or one-handed swing, Challenging (two successes) if from a two-handed 
			swing or a one-handed swing with a mass weapon, and Difficult (three successes) if from a two-handed swing with 
			a mass weapon or pole-arm. However, the required number of Successes may never be greater than the Quality of 
			Success on the attack roll; light blows to the legs won’t stagger many opponents, even if delivered by massive 
			weapons.</p>
			
			<p>As another option, any hit at the elbow or below to the weapon arm of somebody wielding a weapon in one hand 
			can also necessitate a Knockdown of the same Challenge Level as above, failure resulting in the weapon being 
			dropped.</p>
			
			<p>A prone character can use only half of their Melee Pool while fighting from the ground. The number of dice 
			used is halved <em>after</em> all other modifiers (Shock, Pain, Blood Loss, etc.) have been applied. If he is 
			knocked down during an ongoing Combat Round, he <em>immediately</em> loses a number of dice from his Melee Pool 
			equal to the difference between his Melee Pool at the beginning of the Round and half that number.</p>
			
			<div class="panel-body bg-warning" id="DIV_Example_Knockdown">
				<p><em><strong>Example</strong>: Togrul begins a Round with MP 13. If he is knocked down during this Round, 
				he immediately loses 6 dice from his Melee Pool (the difference between 13 and 7). Provided nothing else 
				deducts from his Melee Pool, he refreshes his Pool to 7 at the beginning of the next Round.</p>
				
				<p>To get back on his feet while fighting an opponent, he must win a defense Check in a way that would 
				otherwise enable him to assume the role of aggressor. In this case, he can choose between either remaining 
				the defender but getting back to his feet, or becoming the aggressor but remaining on the ground.</em></p>
			</div>
			
			<br/>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_Knockout">Knockout</p>
			<p>Knockout can be a consequence of blows to the head. If the description of a wound contains a Knockout 
			number, this is the Challenge Level the wounded Character needs to pass on an <em>immediate</em> Check of her 
			Knockout Attribute. Failure on this check indicates unconsciousness. Optionally, any blow to the head that fails to 
			cause a wound will still call for a Knockout Check nonetheless, unless the hit was received from a thrust 
			Piercing or thrust Cleaving attack.</p>
			
			<p>The Challenge Level of this Check is Average (one success) if a swung Piercing attack, Challenging (two 
			successes) if a swung Cleaving or thrusting Blunt attack, and Difficult (three successes) if a swung Blunt 
			attack, but may be under no circumstances higher than half the attack’s Quality of Success.</p>
