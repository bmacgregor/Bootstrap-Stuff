			<p class="h2">Ranged Combat Overview</p>
			<p>In Blade, ranged combat can include attacks from a thrown rock to a steel-pronged crossbow, and every 
			conceivable thrown or launched missile in between. Attacks may sometimes occur as a single, sniper-like 
			attack with no chance for the target to react, but more frequently the attack will be launched into a scene 
			of melee, or will perhaps lead to a melee situation. Such attacks are rolled with dice from the character’s 
			Archery Pool (AP), consisting of Aim + Missile Proficiency. For the latter case, ranged combat must be 
			integrated with melee combat, in order to give archers and the like a place in the Order of Limelights. This 
			spot in the Limelight sequence is determined exactly as if the archer was a melee combatant, with the same 
			principles holding true for both participants.</p>

			<p class="h4">Ranged Combat (Continued)</p>
			<p>That is to say that sometimes, when it is clear who is going first (for example when an encounter is 
			initiated by a crossbow bolt from an ambush), the ref will establish the Order of Limelights by calling up 
			players in their logical order. But, in those cases where the sequence is more random, players will be called 
			up to play out their characters’ Limelights in ascending order of CG, as described in greater detail in the 
			section on Limelight and the Combat Round earlier in this chapter.</p>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_MakingAnAttack">Making a Ranged Attack</p>
			<p>During his Limelight, a character intending to launch a missile attack can do so, provided he has the 
			weapon at hand. There is no preparation, loading, or aiming times, as a Limelight is considered a span of 
			time sufficient to accomplish a significant task – and this certainly includes firing a weapon, not merely 
			preparing to fire it. As melee combatants move about during their own Limelights, it will usually not be 
			readily apparent at exactly what distance they are from a missile combatant during the missile combatant’s 
			Limelight, and also not whether there is a free line of sight between the two. The ref is thus called upon 
			to decide these things based upon common sense, the players’ description of their characters’ actions, and 
			also the scene’s dramatic requirements.</p>
			
			<p>If the player of a missile combatant is not happy with the ref’s judgement, he can have his character move 
			into a more advantageous firing position. Such movement to get an unobstructed line of sight, or merely closer 
			to the target is accomplished via a Terrain Check made with dice from the character’s Archery Pool. The ref 
			first announces the Challenge Level to get to closer range, or to achieve a free line of sight (rarely harder 
			than Difficult, if even that), and the player then attempts to pass the Check using dice out of his Archery 
			Pool, rolling any amount of dice desired.</p>
			
			<p>Success does of course mean that the character achieves his objective, while failure signifies that he 
			either must make the shot at longer range or has to contend with some cover obscuring the target, perhaps 
			both – it never means that a shot is outright impossible. A Terrain Check can also be used when a missile 
			combatant is charged by an enemy and must shoot him down before being engaged in melee combat. In such cases, 
			the ref decides the Challenge Level based on how close the charging party currently is, and how ready the 
			missile combatant is to fire.</p>
			
			<p>Casting a spear that is ready in hand before one is engaged will almost never be harder than Average, while 
			spanning and discharging a heavy crossbow may be as difficult as Legendary, provided the attacker isn’t very 
			far off. If, in the situation described in the preceding paragraph, both opponents are important PCs or NPCs, 
			the Terrain Check is an Opposed one. The charging combatant first declares how many dice out of his MP he is 
			going to spend so to engage before he can be fired at, and the missile combatant then declares the number of 
			dice from his Archery Pool he is going to spend. Depending on the ref’s appraisal of the situation (closeness 
			of opponent vs. readiness of the missile weapon), one opponent will likely need a QoS of just 1 to be 
			successful, whereas the other may well need a higher QoS.</p>
			
			<p>Whether the situation is handled by an Opposed Check or not, victory on the part of the missile combatant 
			will mean that he gets a shot in at practically point blank range. Failure does however signify that he will 
			be engaged before he can fire and that the Combat Round immediately commences, with the missile combatant’s 
			initial MP reduced by a number of dice equalling those spent from his Archery Pool on the Terrain Check.</p>
			
			<p>If he was trying to throw a spear or similar weapon useful in close combat, he may opt to retain it in his 
			hand, combat-ready, otherwise he is assumed to have realized in time that his attempt to shoot his opponent 
			would not pan out, has dropped his missile weapon and barely managed to whip out a melee weapon – if he has 
			one.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_RangeIncrements">Range Increments</p>
			<p>Range, like many aspects of Blade combat, is handled in a slightly abstract way. It depends first and 
			foremost on the principle that the ultimate limitation to all range is human vision - it doesn’t matter one 
			whit that a heavy crossbow may well be able to launch a bolt over 300 yards when one can’t clearly discern the 
			target at such range. Even missile weapons with theoretical maximum ranges as long as some bows and crossbows 
			have realistic practical ranges that are only a fraction of that maximum. Extreme ranges are for wide-shooting 
			contests and battlefield area-fire, not for taking down individual targets.</p>
			
			<p>Practical ranges vary from 2-100 meters, and are divided into Range Bands from Point Blank to Extreme. What 
			actual distance each Range Band signifies is different for each type of ranged weapon. Weapons that are thrown 
			in such a way that they tumble while in the air (knifes and hatchets) have the least range, while those that 
			are cast to fly straight (spears and javelins) middling range, and finally those that are launched (arrows, 
			bolts and sling stones) the greatest.</p>
			
			<p>Each Range Band determines how difficult or easy it is to aim for a specific body part by governing how 
			many dice from the Archery Pool must be spent for a single +/-1 modifier on Table 18. The Target Zone of a 
			ranged attack is determined randomly by rolling 2D6 on Table 4.5. A missile combatant does however have some 
			degree of control over the exact Target Zone by spending dice from his Archery Pool before rolling for the 
			attack.</p>
			
			<p>The number of dice needed to be spent for a single +/-1 move on Table 18 is listed in each range band found 
			in Table 4.4. Also note that at Point Blank range, the missile combatant receives a free modifier of +/-2; if 
			your target is right in front of you, one is not likely to aim either high or low. Apart from this free +/- 2, 
			the cost for further desired modifiers is the same as Near range. This modifier does not have to be spent in 
			full on Table 4.5; it can also be spent in part or not at all, depending on the player’s wishes.</p>

			<p class="h4" id="P_Cover">Cover</p>
			<p>Cover can complicate a ranged attack, and while some obstacles can be avoided by means of a Terrain Check, 
			this is not possible in all cases – no maneuvering in the world will do away with the cover given by a 
			breastwork to defenders manning a wall. Soft cover that merely obstructs vision but does not completely block 
			it, like foliage or a moving crowd of people, does impart a negative modifier to the Archery Pool.</p>
			
			<p>Depending on the ref’s judgement of how much the target is obstructed from clear view by soft cover, this 
			modifier can range from –1 to –3 per line on Table 4.4. The possible modifiers are therefore for example –1, 
			–2, or –3 at Point Blank range (line one on Table 4.4), and –3, –6, and –9 at Medium range. It can range from 
			a mild –1 for a target at Point Blank range past a single person moving through the line of sight, to a 
			whopping –15 for a target at Extreme range that is made almost invisible by the densest of foliage.</p>
			
			<p>The rules for soft cover also apply if one wants to fire into an on-going melee and hit one combatant while 
			avoiding the other, which is of course difficult due to the unpredictable movements of both. In such a case, 
			the minimum penalty for soft cover (i.e. –1 per line on Table 4.4, effectively –1 to –5) is used – and a Botch 
			on the attack roll should usually mean a hit on a person the missile combatant does not wish to hit.</p>
			
			<p>If that happens, the attack roll is repeated. The original penalty dice for firing into a melee still apply 
			for this roll, but neither penalty dice for soft cover, nor any dice possibly set aside for buying modifiers 
			on Table 4.5 do. Any such penalty dice on the original roll are added to the new attack roll, and any hit 
			resulting from this second roll applied to the new target. The exact attack location on the new target is 
			determined randomly on Table 4.5, with no modifiers to this roll.</p>
			
			<div class="panel-body bg-warning" id="DIV_Example_RangedCombat">
				<p><em><strong>Example</strong>: Otho is throwing his dagger at Far range to aid his friend Galen in his 
				melee against two opponents. Otho has an Archery Pool of 13, from which 4 dice are subtracted for firing 
				into a melee at Far range, and a further 3 dice for buying a +/–1 modifier on Table 4.5. Otho Botches the 
				attack roll with his remaining 6 dice, and has to reroll his attack, now with Galen as target. The 4 dice 
				penalty for firing into a melee still applies, but the 3 dice traded in for a +/–1 modifier don’t; his 
				Archery Pool is therefore 10.</p>
				
				<p>Should the attack hit, the damage location will be determined randomly on Table 19, without the +/–1 
				modifier Otho had purchased for his original attack.</em></p>

			<p>Hard cover that cannot be fired through represents a more extreme problem for a missile combatant. If it 
			can’t be circumvented to get a clear shot, the attacker will just have to take his chances by investing heavily 
			into modifiers on Table 4.5 and hope that this modifier is sufficient to hit a location that is not covered.</p>
			
			<p>Defending against missile attacks is of course only possible against attacks that one is aware of. It is 
			preferably done with a large shield, or alternatively be evading. Details on that process and its associated 
			TNs can be found in the section on defending above.</p>
