			<p class="h2">Limelight and the Combat Round</p>
			<p>The basic temporal unit any Combat Scene in Blade is the Combat Round. During the Combat Round, every 
			combatant has dice to spend on actions equal to his Melee Pool (MP). Players will have to be judicious about 
			what activities they spend their MP dice on, and all associated costs to their MP pool. A subdivision of the 
			Combat Round is the Exchange, with every Combat Round consisting of two.</p>
			
			<p>The Exchange is thus the shortest temporal division of a Combat Scene, which ultimately consists of any 
			number of Combat Rounds, each made up of a pair of Exchanges. In <em>Blade</em>, combat is never handled by 
			going around the table from player to player in order every single Round, let alone Exchange. Instead, every 
			player goes through a number of Rounds before it is the next player’s turn. This collection of unbroken Combat 
			Rounds is called the “Limelight”.</p>

			<p class="h4" id="P_Limelight">Limelight Overview</p>
			<p>Limelight harks back to the way swashbuckling fights were once portrayed in movies, when the camera focused 
			on one combatant and his enemies for an intense set of actions and then, at a suitably dramatic moment, cut 
			to another exciting moment within the scene. This cut to another moment sometimes pulled the viewer back in 
			time, if the scene’s new focus took place prior to the moment cut from. This tried and true dramatic way of 
			portraying fights is reborn in Blade.</p>
			
			<p>There are no firm rules as to how many Combat Rounds a Limelight has, only guidelines when to end it and 
			“cut” to another player’s Limelight. Generally speaking, a Limelight is terminated at the end of its first 
			Combat Round in which something significant happens. We call this a <strong>cliff-hanger</strong>! A 
			cliff-hanger can be a wound being inflicted, a combatant being killed, a weapon being lost or knocked away, 
			a change in how the fight is being waged, for instance when the opponents switch from Melee combat to a 
			grappling match, or any other noticeable change in the flow of the fight. Once something like this happens, 
			the ref calls an end to one Limelight and switches to another player’s new Limelight.</p>
			
			<p>The order in which players go through their Limelight’s is largely determined at the outset of the fight 
			and then remains fixed, unless changed by player action; see below.</p>
			
			<p>Under some circumstances, for instance when one PC out of several is under surprise attack, it’s obvious 
			whose Limelight is handled first, but in most cases it isn’t. If circumstances don’t dictate the order of 
			Limelight’s, the ref taps players in ascending order of their Character's Cunning; lower Cunning levels go 
			first and high Cunning levels go last, with ties broken by Reflex, or by the highest Melee Proficiency, if 
			still tied. However, any player whose character’s Cunning is higher than the Cunning of the PC being called 
			up by the ref may opt to step in before the round begins and have his PC’s Limelight resolved earlier. Thus 
			characters with high CG have control of the initial Limelight order.</p>
			
			<p>Once every player at the table has had a Limelight, what’s called a Round of Limelights, the order of 
			Limelights is established, and this order remains unchanged for the entire combat – unless player’s step in to 
			change this sequence.</p>
			
			<br/>
			
			<p class="h4">A Word on Time</p>
			<p>Neither Exchanges nor Combat Rounds take a fixed amount of time. Depending on circumstances, a Round may 
			easily be as little as 1 second and as much as 5 seconds, or even more; as long as a PC is going through his 
			Limelight, there is no telling how much time has actually passed. However, once a Round of Limelights has 
			been completed, time snaps back, and the PCs all realign to the same point in time. Thus the player who has 
			in his Limelight played through five Combat Rounds is at the same point in time as the player who played 
			through just two.</p>
			
			<p>At any time between one player’s Limelight completion, but before the next player’s Limelight commences, 
			any player who has not yet had his Limelight moment within the round may step in and “Steal the Limelight”, 
			thus having his Limelight conducted immediately. Doing so requires the payment of 1 Drama point, and the sole 
			caution that the player who Steals the Limelight must not yet have had his Limelight moment during the 
			current Round of Limelights.</p>
			
			<p>By Stealing the Limelight, the sequence of Limelights is changed – and remains changed. The player who has 
			spent the Drama point has thereby elevated himself from his old place in the sequence to the new one, and the 
			order of Limelights created by this act of Stealing the Limelight becomes the new order of Limelights for the 
			remainder of the combat – or until someone else Steals the Limelight yet again. Stealing the Limelight can be 
			advantageous in many situations, and is often done to enable one PC to rush to another character’s aid.</p>
			
			<div class="panel-body bg-warning" id="DIV_Example_Limelights">
				<p><em><strong>Example</strong>: Three characters, Rufo, Karg, and Otho, are each fighting an enemy in 
				this order during the current round of Limelights. When the second Round of Limelights begins, all three 
				are engaged in melee combat. Having his Limelight first, Rufo is wounded during it, an appropriate point 
				for the ref to cut to Karg’s Limelight.</p>
				
				<p>Sometime into Karg’s Limelight, he and his opponent go from melee into a grappling ground fight, again 
				a useful juncture to cut to Otho, who during his Limelight dispatches his opponent, thereby ending his 
				own Limelight. A new Round of Limelights begins, with Rufo going first – but as Rufo has just been wounded, 
				there is a danger of him being killed by his opponent’s coup de grace, so Otho’s player decides to spend 
				1 Drama point to Steal the Lime light. Otho, now going first and being unengaged, has by Stealing the 
				Limelight, gained a chance to rush to injured Rufo’s side and save him.</em></p>
			</div>
			
			<br/>
			
			<p>In quite a few fights, not all PCs will actually be Melee combatants, or combatants at all, and their 
			Limelights conversely work a bit differently. While their place in the sequence of Limelights is determined 
			normally, instead of fighting, they use their Limelight to do one relevant thing. Doing something relevant - 
			this truly is the heart of the matter: Not preparing for something relevant, but doing it, all the way. This 
			relevant action could be a lot of things. Often, it will be firing a missile (and yes, even cocking a heavy 
			crossbow, loading and then discharging it are accomplished within the space of a single Limelight) or casting 
			a spell, but it might be picking a lock, breaking down a door, lighting a fire, untethering the group’s 
			horses – anything really.</p>
			
			<p>The sole constraint is that the action should be one that could conceivably be accomplished within the 
			space of 30 seconds. So, all sorcery and missile attacks work alike in melee situations. You can use your 
			pool, whether Archery Pool or SP, once, and only once per Limelight. That said, there is nothing to prevent a 
			sorcerer from beginning a Limelight using his MP and then switching over to a sorcerous action and using his 
			SP. This would be governed by exactly the same mechanics as somebody switching over from using his MP to 
			using his Archery Pool. But note that he may do so only at the beginning of a round’s 2nd Exchange, with an 
			upfront SP Activation Cost equaling the amount of MP spent by him during the 1st Exchange. This represents 
			the rigors of invoking sorcery in the middle of a hectic melee.</p>
			
			<p>NPCs, even the most important ones, do not have a Limelight of their own. An NPC’s opportunity to act 
			arrives when the PC with whom he is locked in some kind of struggle or other interaction has his own Limelight. 
			If this PC moves to a new place within the Order of Limelights, the NPC moves with him. In those cases, where 
			NPCs not currently in some form of contest with a PC try to accomplish something entirely on their own and 
			unopposed by a PC (e.g. breaking down a door), the referee should adjudicate this action with common sense and 
			just announce its progress or completion as seems right.</p>
			
			<p>In those very rare and exceptional cases when timing should be more important, such an NPC can be given a 
			place within the Order of Limelights of his own. This is however only possible for as long as this NPC does 
			not interact with a PC; the moment he starts interacting with a PC (e.g. having broken down the door, the NPC 
			charges the PC), he loses his own place within the Order of Limelights and commences acting on the PC’s 
			Limelight.</p>
			
			<p>All NPCs must be assigned to a given PC’s Limelight right at the beginning of that Limelight, with all 
			players being informed of any NPC attached to his character’s current Limelight, whether the character would 
			be aware of the presence of the NPC or not. An NPC who was not assigned to a PC’s Limelight cannot interact 
			with that PC during this Limelight.</p>
			
			<p>In addition, an NPC can only be assigned to one PC’s Limelight during any given Round of Limelights; should 
			he fail to act on this Limelight, he cannot be reassigned to another Limelight later taking place during the 
			current Round of Limelights.</p>
