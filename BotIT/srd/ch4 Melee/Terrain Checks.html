			<p class="h2">Terrain Checks</p>
			<p>Terrain Checks in Blade take place within the abstracted combat environment. During a melee, it is not 
			only common but actually necessary that combatants twist and turn about, advance and step back, so that once 
			a combat begins, all fighters will by default move significantly from the spot they occupied at its outset.</p>
			
			<p>Even a single Combat Round might easily shift the combatants as much as five meters in an unforeseen 
			direction, and frequently more; that’s the nature of footwork. Once a combat with multiple fighters has been 
			underway for even one Round, it is nigh impossible to determine where anyone is in respect to anyone else – 
			except as it relates to one’s own immediate opponents.</p>
		</div>

	<div class="container text-justify">

			<p>Their own footwork, the press of enemies, and wheeling manoeuvres will have carried every pair of fighters 
			in a largely random direction, where allies who started out fighting side by side will by necessity find 
			themselves separated very quickly. In short, as long a Limelight is underway, it is impossible to tell where 
			anyone is in respect to anyone else.</p>
			
			<p>Locations are roughly re-established once a Limelight ends, and with certainty when a Round of Limelights 
			completes. Positions are determined by the ref’s common sense, based on what has happened during the previous 
			Round of Limelights. As a player vividly describes his combat actions, the ref is encouraged to take note and 
			visualize the PC’s end location within the combat environment. It can thus happen that a player finds his PC 
			in a location where he doesn’t want him to be, which is only a concern if the PC is desperately needed 
			elsewhere.</p>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_EngagingDistantFoes">Engaging a Distant Foe</p>
			<p>If the character wants to engage somebody who is quite a distance away, or get to any other location in the 
			combat environment, this is not handled by measuring movement, but by a Terrain Check.</p>
			
			<p>A Terrain Check is made with dice from the character’s MP – any number of dice, player’s choice. The ref 
			sets the Difficulty of the Check by how far and over what difficult terrain the character will have to move, 
			but it will rarely, if ever, be greater than a Difficult Challenge Rating. If the optional Encumbrance rules 
			are being used, every Terrain Check other than one for bad footing or refusing to be dislodged from a fixed 
			location carries an Activation Cost that can be found in Table 5.2. If several such Terrain Checks should be 
			made during the same Combat Round, this Activation Cost must be paid separately for every Check.</p>
			
			<p>If the Check is passed, the character arrives at the point he wanted to reach “in time”, whatever that may 
			mean (usually to engage somebody in melee with the dice remaining in his MP), and if not, he arrives there 
			“late”.</p>
			
			<div class="panel-body bg-warning" id="DIV_Example_Terrain">
				<p><em><strong>Example</strong>: Returning to where we abandoned Otho in the previous example, right after 
				spending a point of Drama to have his Limelight out of the usual order to rush to Rufo’s aid, the ref 
				tells Otho’s player that 2 Successes on the Terrain Check are necessary to get to Rufo’s side in time.</p>
				
				<p>Playing it safe, Otho’s player opts to spend 6 dice, and achieves 3 Successes. Rushing at Rufo’s enemy, 
				Otho attacks with the remaining dice in his MP, just in time to save his companion.</em></p>
			</div>
			
			<p>Failing this kind of Terrain Check should only rarely, if at all, be interpreted as the player having 
			wasted his Limelight on a failed attempt. Instead, the ref should give him some thing else to do, or a new 
			unexpected challenge. A failure might for example be interpreted as the character being intercepted by a new 
			enemy, if applicable. The use of Terrain Checks are not limited to simply getting somewhere on time. A 
			Terrain Check may also be needed to navigate an area with poor footing.</p>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_TypesOfFooting">Types of Footing</p>
			<p>Normal footing like broken ground, light snow, mud, or deep sand do not necessitate a Check, but truly 
			poor areas such as steep, slippery slopes, scree fields, stairs, narrow ledges, ice, deep snow, or water and 
			the like, do. If all combatants of a particular Melee are on this kind of difficult ground, 2 dice are 
			deducted from everyone’s MP and the need for a Check simply done away with. If only one combatant is on poor 
			ground, a Terrain Check must be made for that character.</p>
			
			<p>If he achieves even a single Success with the dice he sets aside for this purpose, he can act and move 
			normally, but if not, he slips, stumbles, or falls down. It is thus clearly advantageous to fight on level 
			ground while forcing one’s opponent into a position of poor footing. Provided there is poor ground nearby, 
			Terrain Checks can also be used to force an opponent onto such bad footing, and keep him there, or to get out 
			of it oneself. Such attempts are handled through an Opposed Terrain Check. The initiator of the attempt 
			announces a number of dice from his MP to be used, after which his opponent sets aside a number of dice from 
			his MP as well, then both roll. To win the contest, the initiator needs a QoS of 1 if he is currently the 
			aggressor, or 2 if the defender – it is easier to force somebody somewhere than to lure him.</p>
			
			<p>This can even be used to force somebody over a nearby drop, but only if initiated by the aggressor. As 
			people are remarkably reluctant to fall from heights, success on such an attempt does not simply require a 
			QoS of 1, but now at least 3, provided that the drop is of a kind likely to injure the falling person. In many 
			cases, somebody on bad footing facing an enemy on level ground need not force his opponent back so that he can 
			get firm footing himself, but may well opt to simply step back up a pace or two, enticing the opponent to 
			follow him onto the disadvantageous ground and thus evening the odds. This need merely be announced and 
			requires just a normal Terrain Check to avoid slippage on the poor surface, no opposed roll needed; if the 
			opponent declines to follow, the bout ends. However, it is not always feasible to entice the opponent to 
			follow; sometimes one will want to, and have to, fight one’s way onto the opponent’s better ground.</p>
			
			<p>If the opponent is for example holding the head of a stairway or the top of a steep slope against all 
			comers, no normal amount of enticement will force him down to his opponent. While these cases assume at least 
			some room for lateral movement on the holding character’s part, there may be other scenarios, where he cannot 
			move anywhere at all, such as when defending a doorway. While such positions are advantageous in terms of 
			limiting the number of possible attackers, they interdict footwork and thus cramp combat performance.</p>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_HoldingGround">Holding Ground</p>
			<p>An attempt to remain firmly in one spot requires but 1 Success on a Terrain Check – if unopposed. If an 
			enemy is actively trying to dislodge one from a position he is holding, the Terrain Check becomes Opposed. 
			The initiator of the attempt, who must be the current aggressor, declares the number of dice committed, after 
			which his enemy does the same, then both roll. To dislodge the holding person, a victory with a QoS of 1+ is 
			needed; ties signify that the holding opponent remains firmly in place.</p>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_HigherGround">Higher Ground</p>
			<p>Higher footing (as provided by stairs or horses) adds 2 MP at the beginning of the Round (Step 2). This 
			also affects attack zone targeting for all involved combatants according to common sense. Finally, Terrain 
			Checks can be used by a player with multiple opponents to avoid facing several at once. By moving so that 
			his opponents foul each other’s attacks, and by exploiting the environment, the combatant tries to limit the 
			number of opponents he fights this Combat Round. If these opponents are important NPCs, the Terrain Check is 
			an Opposed one.</p>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_AvoidingOpponents">Avoiding Opponents</p>
			<p>The player declares which opponent he wants to avoid. This opponent announces a number of dice from his 
			MP to oppose the PC’s attempt to avoid him, and the player then sets aside a number of dice from his MP 
			himself. An Opposed Check using these dice is then made. A QoS of 0 suffices to attain the player’s objective 
			if the PC wasn’t engaged with the opponent in the previous Combat Round, but a QoS of 1 is required to avoid 
			an opponent with whom he was previously engaged.</p>
			
			<p>This means of breaking off a combat bout can only be used if facing multiple opponents at once, as it 
			represents moving in a manner that has one opponent getting in the other’s way. If facing only one opponent, 
			a bout can only be broken off after a successful Full Evasion, or if both combatants decline to attack. If 
			the first opponent is thus avoided, the next opponent is treated in the same fashion. A number of dice 
			from both MPs are again set aside and an Opposed Check made. The QoS of the previous Opposed Terrain Check 
			for avoiding the first opponent is added as bonus dice to this second Check. There are no additional Checks 
			needed, as it is physically impossible for more than three opponents to beset the same person at the 
			same time.</p>
			
			<p>If the enemies aren’t important NPCs, the Terrain Check is unopposed. If the PC is trying to avoid one 
			of his two opponents, he simply needs a QoS of 1. If he is facing three opponents, a QoS of 3 is required to 
			avoid two opponents, while a QoS of 2 avoids one. At the very outset of the battle, the required QoS for 
			avoiding one or two out of three opponents are reduced by one, provided the PC is not surrounded by his 
			opponents. A QoS of 2 avoids two out of three opponents, and a QoS of 1 one out of three. As soon as the PC 
			has become engaged in combat with any of his opponents, this reduced QoS to avoid opponents no longer 
			applies, nor does it apply if the PC started out surrounded or in a comparably disadvantageous position.</p>
			
			<p>Please note that a character may use a Terrain Check to move into positions where the number of opponents 
			who can engage him at once is limited, for example with his back against a wall. In such an instance a 
			maximum of only two, not three opponents can attempt to engage the character at the same time. There are a few 
			further uses for Terrain Checks, which are discussed in the section on ranged combat.</p>
