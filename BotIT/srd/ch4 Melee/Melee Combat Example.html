			<p>As the Picts rush at Skold, the ref informs the player that the combat will take place on particularly bad 
			footing – the wet rocks of the beach – necessitating a deduction of 2 dice from all combatants’ MPs, bringing 
			them down to 17 and 8 respectively. At the outset of Combat Round One, the referee declares that the Picts’ 
			charge puts them into an aggressive stance and that Skold, seeing them rush at him, has time to prepare him 
			self and declare a stance as well. Wanting to finish this combat before more Picts can arrive, the player has 
			Skold assume an aggressive stance as well and also announces that Skold is going to move in such a way that 
			one Pict is between himself and the other, preventing the second Pict from attacking him right away. This 
			necessitates an (Unopposed) Terrain Check, with a single Success required. The player commits 5 dice (taking 
			his MP to 12) and rolls, achieving 4 Successes (1, 10, 10, 11, 11), for now easily avoiding the second Pict 
			among the rocks and boulders.</p>
			
			<p>The Pict’s intention to attack is apparent from his ferocious charge, and the player declares Skold as 
			attacker as well. As both combatants have assumed aggressive stances, their MPs receive 2 bonus dice each, for 
			14 and 10 respectively.</p>
			
			<p>With both combatants attacking, an Opposed Reflex Check will determine who attacks fractionally first, but 
			Maneuvers and dice must be assigned before this Check. The player announces a Cleave from diagonally above at 
			the Pict’s head and shoulders (Target Zone 4) for 11 dice, executed at Long Reach. The ref declares a Thrust 
			at the groin (Target Zone 10) for all the Pict’s 10 dice.</p>
			
			<p>Both combatants’ Reflex is then Checked, with a TN equal to their weapon’s Attack Target Number; as the 
			Pict’s spear has Reach M and Skold axe Reach L, Skold receives a +1 die bonus and the Pict a corresponding 1 
			die penalty. Skold rolls 7 dice (Reflex 6 +1) against TN 8, achieving but 1 Success (1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 6, and 9). 
			The Pict rolls 4 dice (Reflex 5 –1) against TN 8, achieving 4 Successes (8, 11, 12, 12) – the Pict goes 
			first!</p>
			
			<p>The player has however an ace up his sleeve and has Skold attempt Stealing Initiative. He pays the 
			Activation Cost of 2 dice (half opponent’s SY), and after his previous bad luck decides to play it safe and 
			purchase 1 bonus die for the Check, for a total Activation Cost of 3 dice. This uses up the uncommitted 
			remainder of his MP. The Pict checks DG, with a flat penalty of 1 for having the weapon with shorter Reach, 
			and Skold his own CG, with a flat bonus of 1 for having the weapon with the longer Reach, and the 1 purchased 
			bonus die.</p>
			
			<p>Skold thus rolls 7 dice (CG 5 +1 +1) against a static TN 7, achieving 3 Successes (2, 2, 5, 5, 8, 9, 11). 
			The Pict rolls 4 dice (DG 5 –1) against a static TN 7, achieving 2 Successes (3, 4, 10, 11) – just as the Pict 
			thrusts with his spear, Skold’s axe comes down hard. Skold attacks with the MP dice previously committed, 
			rolling 11 dice against Attack Target Number 8 and achieving 5 Successes (1, 1, 3, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 11, 12). 
			The Pict cannot defend, so the attack QoS is 5. The player rolls d6 on the Cleaving Damage Tables to determine 
			the exact hit location, achieving a 3 for a result of a cross-cut across the Pict’s chest, which is protected 
			by his leather jerkin.</p>
			
			<p>The Impact Rating is determined by then taking the QoS (5), adding half BN (4), and adding Damage Rating 
			(3 +1 for striking armor), for a total of 13. From this Impact Rating is subtracted half the Pict’s BN (3) and 
			his chest Armor Value (2), for a remaining total of 8, corresponding to the maximum Wound Level of 6. As the 
			Pict is just a mook, the Level 6 injury kills him instantly, without any need to consult the Wound Tables.</p>
			
			<p>As Skold has neither MP nor opponent remaining, there is no second Exchange to this Combat Round, and the 
			second Combat Round commences with the remaining Pict charging Skold across the rocky beach. The ref decrees 
			that all fighters still have to deduct 2 dice from their MP for treacherous footing, and that Skold can only 
			just turn in time to receive the charging Pict and cannot thus assume a stance. He announces that the Pict’s 
			charge effectively puts him into aggressive stance. Combat Round two starts with the declaration of attack or 
			defence. The Pict is declared as aggressor, granting him 2 bonus dice from stance for a total MP of 10, and 
			Skold as defender.</p>
			
			<p>Next, the aggressor declares Maneuver and assigned dice – he declares a Thrust with 7 dice at Skold’s crotch 
			(Target Zone 10). Smiling evilly, Skold’s player declares a Counter, paying the Activation Cost of 3 dice and 
			assigning 10 of his remaining 14 MP dice to it. The Pict rolls his assigned 7 dice against Attack Target Number 
			8, with a penalty of 1 for having a weapon one Reach increment shorter than Skold, for a total of 6 dice, and 
			achieves 3 Successes (1, 4, 6, 9, 10, and 11). Skold’s player rolls the assigned 10 dice against the axe’s 
			DTN of 8, as per the Counter rules, achieving 4 Successes (4, 4, 5, 6,7, 7, 8, 9, 9, 10). With a defense QoS 
			of 1, a sweep of the axe knocks aside the thrusting spear harmlessly and the attacker now on Exchange Two 
			assumes the role of defender (with Counter, even a defense QoS of 0 would allow him to do so).</p>
			
			<p>Exchange Two commences with Skold assuming the role of aggressor. The Pict has 3 remaining MP dice and so 
			Skold 4, but as per the Counter rules, Skold receives dice equal to the total Successes in the countered attack 
			as bonus dice for his follow-up attack; as the Pict achieved 3 Successes, so Skold now receives 3 bonus dice, 
			for an MP of 7.</p>
			
			<p>The Exchange begins with the declaration of attack, with the player declaring an attack with all 7 dice, 
			randomly as per the rules for the follow-up on a Counter. A d12 is rolled on Counter Table 3.3 to determine 
			the exact nature of Skold’s attack, and yields a result of 2, a cross-cut at thigh height. The Pict declares a 
			Block with his remaining 3 dice as his defense.</p>
			
			<p>The player rolls the assigned 7 dice against Attack Target Number 8, achieving 4 Successes (2, 6, 7, 8, 8, 
			8, 11). The Pict rolls 3 dice against his shield’s DTN 6, achieving 2 Successes (2, 8, 10), for an attack QoS 
			of 2. The player rolls d6 on the Cleaving Tables to determine exact hit location, achieving a 4 for a cut to 
			the thigh, which is unarmored.</p>
			
			<p>The Impact Rating is determined by taking the attack QoS (2), adding half BN (4) and weapon Damage Rating 
			(3), for a total of 9. From the Impact Rating is subtracted half the defender’s BN (3), for a net total of 6, 
			once again enough to kill a mook like the Pict without the need to look up the injury on the Wound Table.</p>
			
			<p>Exchange Two of Combat Round Two ends with the second Pict falling down dead or dying. Combat Round Three 
			begins with the referee announcing that the 2 dice penalty for bad footing does not apply to the prone Pict, 
			but that Skold is still on bad footing; as he is the only combatant standing, he does not simply subtract 2 
			dice, but rather must pass a Terrain Check to avoid falling. The Pict is prone and thus at half MP, for an MP 
			of 5. To this, Shock 15 from the preceding Exchange is applied; Thus bringing the Pict’s MP to 0, and the 
			remaining 10 dice added as bonus dice to Skold MP against the Pict, raising his MP for the Combat Round to 
			27.</p>
			
			<p>Two Picts charged Skold Skullsplitter. He wheeled, getting one between himself and the other. Skold then 
			brought his axe down a mere blink of an eye before his Pictish opponent’s spear thrust hit home, cleaving the 
			savage’s chest to the spine and knocking him to the ground dead. He then wheeled to receive the second Pict, 
			coolly swept aside his opponent’s spear thrust with his axe, and in the same fluid motion brought the weapon 
			around in a narrow arc, dipping under the shield’s rim to sever the Pict’s leg just below the crotch. With the 
			fallen Pict screaming on the ground and spurting out his life in but a few heartbeats, Skold leaves the scene 
			of carnage.</p>
