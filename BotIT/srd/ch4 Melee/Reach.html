			<p class="h4" id="P_Reach">Weapon Reach</p>
			<p>Weapon Reach plays an enormous role in any combat. Weapon Reach is in six distinct Steps:</p>
			
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Hand</strong>: Fists, daggers, knee-strikes, grappling, etc.</li>
				<li><strong>Short</strong>: Long daggers, short swords, maces, etc.</li>
				<li><strong>Medium</strong>: Arming swords, ball-and-chains, sabers, short spears, etc.</li>
				<li><strong>Long</strong>: Hand-and-a-half swords, rapiers, spears, short polearms, etc.</li>
				<li><strong>Very Long</strong>: Greatswords, long polearms, etc.</li>
				<li><strong>Extremely Long</strong>: Lances, pikes, etc.</li>
			</ol>
			
			<p>Engaging the wielder of a longer weapon is conducted at -1 MP penalty for each Reach increment (Hand to 
			Short, Short to Medium, etc.) the attacker needs to close; the extreme case of engaging a pike man with bare 
			fists would carry a penalty of 5 MP. This penalty holds until the shorter weapon makes a damaging strike, after 
			which the penalty transfers to the longer weapon until he scores a damaging blow, when again the penalty goes 
			to the shorter weapon. When the shorter weapon is out of range this penalty applies only to attacks; when the 
			longer weapon is penalized, it applies to both offense and defense. Often the best course of action for long 
			weapons is to use a full evasion in the event of sudden close combat, or to drop weapons and wrestle! Certain 
			maneuvers (such as the Half-sword) are particularly effective in such situations.</p>
			
			<p>Likewise, many weapons—such as spears and other two-handed weapons— may shorten their reach. Botching in 
			combat is left for the referee to introduce as Complications at dramatic moments, to spice up events, increase 
			tension, and put pressure on the PCs. Still, if a group absolutely feels it has to have a mechanic for random 
			botches, this optional rule can be used:</p>
			
			<p><em>When an attack or defence comes up with 0 Successes, a botch results. No Complication arises from this 
			botch, but the character’s MP for the remainder of the Combat Round, or the following Combat Round if the 
			botch occurs on the second Exchange, is reduced by the number of dice rolled on the botched Check. In addition, 
			if the botched roll was made with 5+ dice, something else detrimental also happens. The exact nature of this 
			fumble is up to the referee, but most likely occurrences are the weapon breaking or slipping from the 
			character’s hand, or the character slipping and falling.</em></p>
