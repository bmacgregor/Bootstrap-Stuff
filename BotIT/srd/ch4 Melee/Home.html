			<p class="h2">Melee Combat Overview</p>
			<p>The world of <em>Blade</em> is a dangerous one. Though fierce monsters and abominations inhabit the far 
			corners of the world, adventurers must also be on the lookout for thugs, cutpurses, assassins, mercenaries 
			and anybody else who would kill them for their silver. And the most deadly foes care nothing for treasure, 
			and instead want a hero’s corpse for darker purposes...</p>
			
			<p>As characters adventure throughout the world, they will encounter those who stand in their way. 
			Unfortunately, not all villains will launch themselves at the characters with sword in hand. The more 
			dangerous ones use their snake tongues, devious minds, or sorcery to bring the heroes to ruin. Good referees 
			will throw all types of foes against characters – those who fight with tooth and claw, cowards who would 
			sooner run than battle, and those who seek to undermine adventurers with a labyrinth of plans and 
			deception.</p>
			
			<p>Sometimes, battle is inevitable. Though the warriors of Blade are well trained and deadly, even the most 
			inexperienced knave can thrust a pitchfork into the throat of a battle-hardened king. Players should always 
			keep in mind that more people walk into battle than walk from it...</p>

			<p class="h4" id="P_Limelight">1. Limelight and the Combat Round</p>
			<p>The basic temporal unit any Combat Scene in Blade is the Combat Round. During the Combat Round, every 
			combatant has dice to spend on actions equal to his Melee Pool (MP). Players will have to be judicious about 
			what activities they spend their MP dice on, and all associated costs to their MP pool. A subdivision of the 
			Combat Round is the Exchange, with every Combat Round consisting of two.</p>
			
			<p>The Exchange is thus the shortest temporal division of a Combat Scene, which ultimately consists of any 
			number of Combat Rounds, each made up of a pair of Exchanges. In <em>Blade</em>, combat is never handled by 
			going around the table from player to player in order every single Round, let alone Exchange. Instead, every 
			player goes through a number of Rounds before it is the next player’s turn. This collection of unbroken Combat 
			Rounds is called the “Limelight”.</p>
			
			<p>Limelight harks back to the way swashbuckling fights were once portrayed in movies, when the camera focused 
			on one combatant and his enemies for an intense set of actions and then, at a suitably dramatic moment, cut 
			to another exciting moment within the scene. This cut to another moment sometimes pulled the viewer back in 
			time, if the scene’s new focus took place prior to the moment cut from. This tried and true dramatic way of 
			portraying fights is reborn in Blade.</p>
			
			<p>There are no firm rules as to how many Combat Rounds a Limelight has, only guidelines when to end it and 
			“cut” to another player’s Limelight. Generally speaking, a Limelight is terminated at the end of its first 
			Combat Round in which something significant happens. We call this a <strong>cliff-hanger</strong>! A 
			cliff-hanger can be a wound being inflicted, a combatant being killed, a weapon being lost or knocked away, 
			a change in how the fight is being waged, for instance when the opponents switch from Melee combat to a 
			grappling match, or any other noticeable change in the flow of the fight. Once something like this happens, 
			the ref calls an end to one Limelight and switches to another player’s new Limelight.</p>
			
			<p>The order in which players go through their Limelight’s is largely determined at the outset of the fight 
			and then remains fixed, unless changed by player action; see below.</p>
			
			<p>Under some circumstances, for instance when one PC out of several is under surprise attack, it’s obvious 
			whose Limelight is handled first, but in most cases it isn’t. If circumstances don’t dictate the order of 
			Limelight’s, the ref taps players in ascending order of their Character's Cunning; lower Cunning levels go 
			first and high Cunning levels go last, with ties broken by Reflex, or by the highest Melee Proficiency, if 
			still tied. However, any player whose character’s Cunning is higher than the Cunning of the PC being called 
			up by the ref may opt to step in before the round begins and have his PC’s Limelight resolved earlier. Thus 
			characters with high CG have control of the initial Limelight order.</p>
			
			<p>Once every player at the table has had a Limelight, what’s called a Round of Limelights, the order of 
			Limelights is established, and this order remains unchanged for the entire combat – unless player’s step in to 
			change this sequence.</p>
			
			<p class="h4">A Word on Time</p>
			<p>Neither Exchanges nor Combat Rounds take a fixed amount of time. Depending on circumstances, a Round may 
			easily be as little as 1 second and as much as 5 seconds, or even more; as long as a PC is going through his 
			Limelight, there is no telling how much time has actually passed. However, once a Round of Limelights has 
			been completed, time snaps back, and the PCs all realign to the same point in time. Thus the player who has 
			in his Limelight played through five Combat Rounds is at the same point in time as the player who played 
			through just two.</p>
			
			<p>At any time between one player’s Limelight completion, but before the next player’s Limelight commences, 
			any player who has not yet had his Limelight moment within the round may step in and “Steal the Limelight”, 
			thus having his Limelight conducted immediately. Doing so requires the payment of 1 Drama point, and the sole 
			caution that the player who Steals the Limelight must not yet have had his Limelight moment during the 
			current Round of Limelights.</p>
			
			<p>By Stealing the Limelight, the sequence of Limelights is changed – and remains changed. The player who has 
			spent the Drama point has thereby elevated himself from his old place in the sequence to the new one, and the 
			order of Limelights created by this act of Stealing the Limelight becomes the new order of Limelights for the 
			remainder of the combat – or until someone else Steals the Limelight yet again. Stealing the Limelight can be 
			advantageous in many situations, and is often done to enable one PC to rush to another character’s aid.</p>
			
			<div class="panel-body bg-warning" id="DIV_Example_Limelights">
				<p><em><strong>Example</strong>: Three characters, Rufo, Karg, and Otho, are each fighting an enemy in 
				this order during the current round of Limelights. When the second Round of Limelights begins, all three 
				are engaged in melee combat. Having his Limelight first, Rufo is wounded during it, an appropriate point 
				for the ref to cut to Karg’s Limelight.</p>
				
				<p>Sometime into Karg’s Limelight, he and his opponent go from melee into a grappling ground fight, again 
				a useful juncture to cut to Otho, who during his Limelight dispatches his opponent, thereby ending his 
				own Limelight. A new Round of Limelights begins, with Rufo going first – but as Rufo has just been wounded, 
				there is a danger of him being killed by his opponent’s coup de grace, so Otho’s player decides to spend 
				1 Drama point to Steal the Lime light. Otho, now going first and being unengaged, has by Stealing the 
				Limelight, gained a chance to rush to injured Rufo’s side and save him.</em></p>
			</div>
			
			<br/>
			
			<p>In quite a few fights, not all PCs will actually be Melee combatants, or combatants at all, and their 
			Limelights conversely work a bit differently. While their place in the sequence of Limelights is determined 
			normally, instead of fighting, they use their Limelight to do one relevant thing. Doing something relevant - 
			this truly is the heart of the matter: Not preparing for something relevant, but doing it, all the way. This 
			relevant action could be a lot of things. Often, it will be firing a missile (and yes, even cocking a heavy 
			crossbow, loading and then discharging it are accomplished within the space of a single Limelight) or casting 
			a spell, but it might be picking a lock, breaking down a door, lighting a fire, untethering the group’s 
			horses – anything really.</p>
			
			<p>The sole constraint is that the action should be one that could conceivably be accomplished within the 
			space of 30 seconds. So, all sorcery and missile attacks work alike in melee situations. You can use your 
			pool, whether Archery Pool or SP, once, and only once per Limelight. That said, there is nothing to prevent a 
			sorcerer from beginning a Limelight using his MP and then switching over to a sorcerous action and using his 
			SP. This would be governed by exactly the same mechanics as somebody switching over from using his MP to 
			using his Archery Pool. But note that he may do so only at the beginning of a round’s 2nd Exchange, with an 
			upfront SP Activation Cost equaling the amount of MP spent by him during the 1st Exchange. This represents 
			the rigors of invoking sorcery in the middle of a hectic melee.</p>
			
			<p>NPCs, even the most important ones, do not have a Limelight of their own. An NPC’s opportunity to act 
			arrives when the PC with whom he is locked in some kind of struggle or other interaction has his own Limelight. 
			If this PC moves to a new place within the Order of Limelights, the NPC moves with him. In those cases, where 
			NPCs not currently in some form of contest with a PC try to accomplish something entirely on their own and 
			unopposed by a PC (e.g. breaking down a door), the referee should adjudicate this action with common sense and 
			just announce its progress or completion as seems right.</p>
			
			<p>In those very rare and exceptional cases when timing should be more important, such an NPC can be given a 
			place within the Order of Limelights of his own. This is however only possible for as long as this NPC does 
			not interact with a PC; the moment he starts interacting with a PC (e.g. having broken down the door, the NPC 
			charges the PC), he loses his own place within the Order of Limelights and commences acting on the PC’s 
			Limelight.</p>
			
			<p>All NPCs must be assigned to a given PC’s Limelight right at the beginning of that Limelight, with all 
			players being informed of any NPC attached to his character’s current Limelight, whether the character would 
			be aware of the presence of the NPC or not. An NPC who was not assigned to a PC’s Limelight cannot interact 
			with that PC during this Limelight.</p>
			
			<p>In addition, an NPC can only be assigned to one PC’s Limelight during any given Round of Limelights; should 
			he fail to act on this Limelight, he cannot be reassigned to another Limelight later taking place during the 
			current Round of Limelights.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_CombatOrder">2. The Order of a Combat Round</p>
			<p>A Combat Round is fought in the following sequence:</p>
			
			<ol>
				<li>All stances are declared.</li>
				<li>Aggressor and defender is established (initiative). Melee Pool fills/refreshes, with all Modifiers.</li>
				<li>During the first half of the Combat Round, the first Exchange, the aggressor attacks and defender 
				defends.</li>
				<li>Damage is resolved and/or new attitude determined (aggressor or defender).</li>
				<li>During the second half of the Combat Round, the second Exchange, the aggressor attacks and defender 
				defends. These roles may have been reversed since the first Exchange.</li>
				<li>All damage is resolved and/or new attitude determined (aggressor or defender).</li>
			</ol>
			
			<p>Steps 2-6 continue to repeat until the resolution of the combat, or until the flow of combat is interrupted 
			otherwise (a pause). At the beginning of each new melee conflict (or following a pause) begin at step 1, then 
			repeat 2-6 as normal.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4">3. Steps 1 & 2: Stances, Initiative, and Surprise</p>
			<p>Unless taken by surprise, combatants will usually have time and opportunity to declare a stance – these 
			should be clearly announced at the table. Stances potentially provide for a stronger attack or defence, though 
			perhaps adding some rigidity to a combatant’s action.</p>
			
			<p>Though every school speaks with confidence on the superiority of its teaching, three stances are universal; 
			Aggressive, Defensive, and Neutral stances.</p>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_Stance_Aggressive">Aggressive Stance</p>
			<p>Aggressive stances provide an attack bonus at the cost of making one’s defense more difficult. Assuming 
			them adds 2 MP dice for an attack but increases Activation Costs for Defensive Maneuvers by 2 MP.</p>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_Stance_Defensive">Defensive Stance</p>
			<p>Defensive stances grant a defensive bonus while making attack execution more difficult. Such stances add 2 
			MP dice when Defending but increase the activation costs for any Offensive Maneuver by 2 MP.</p>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_Stance_Neutral">Neutral Stance</p>
			<p>Neutral stances are the favorite of many. In a Neutral stance one’s weapon is positioned to allow for either 
			quick attack or defensive response. Neutral stances provide no bonus to either attack or defense.</p>
			
			<p><em>Note: Stances are only in effect until the first blow or movement—once a character’s weapon moves, the 
			stance is gone. Once melee is joined the stances of both attacker and defender are treated as neutral, with 
			no bonus conveyed to either. A stance cannot be taken (or regained) until the combatants separate for a full 
			pause.</em></p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_Initiative">Initiative</p>
			<p>Initiative is determined after any stances are declared, when each combatant announces their intent to 
			either attack or defend. The intent of the combatants will usually be very clear from the circumstances under 
			which they enter combat – more often than not, one or even both will charge the other. Apart from of course 
			counting as an aggressive stance, such a charge automatically suggests the intent to attack, leaving the 
			other party to decide whether to receive the charge with a defence or to himself attack.</p>
			
			<p>Some rare combat encounters, for example formal duels or gladiatorial bouts, may however start out less 
			unambiguous, with both combatants gauging each other, shifting from stance to stance and waiting for an 
			opening in their opponent’s defence to attack. In these cases, it is advisable to demand that both parties 
			declare intent to attack or defend simultaneously, maybe by lifting one finger for attack and two for defence. 
			Until at least one party declares attack, the bout does not actually commence.</p>
			
			<p>If a party fails to declare intent while the other declares attack, then this character is considered to 
			have hesitated and may only defend for one full Combat Round – if even that (see Surprise).</p>
			
			<p>The attacker, now having the initiative, declares how many dice from his Melee Pool are being spent on the 
			attack, where the attack is aimed, and what Maneuver, if any, is being used.</p>
			
			<p>The defender in response to the attacker declares how many dice from his Melee Pool are going towards 
			defense, what defense is being used, and what Maneuver, if any, is being executed.</p>
			
			<p>If both combatants declare as aggressors, Offensive Maneuvers and assigned dice are announced before the 
			Reflex Check to see who goes fractionally first. The combatant with the higher Reflex may choose whether to 
			declare first or second; tied Reflex scores are broken by the higher CG score, and tied CG scores by the 
			higher Proficiency.</p>
			
			<p>An Opposed Reflex Check (with the combatants’ own Attack Target Number for Target Numbers — see the 
			Appendix for weapon Attack Target Numbers) then determines whose strike lands first. For every step of Reach 
			difference of the weapons used, the wielder of the longer weapon receives 1 bonus dice to this Check, and the 
			wielder of the shorter weapon is penalized 1 die. In the rare cases where the combat begins at the optimum 
			engagement range of the shorter Reach weapon, these modifiers are reversed.</p>
			
			<p>Note that no defense is possible in the middle of an attack, so the loser of this Check will likely be 
			killed. In the Exchange that follows, the winner of this Exchange now assumes the role of aggressor and his 
			opponent that of defender. Should the Opposed Reflex Check be tied, both combatants strike at exactly the same 
			time.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_StealInitiative">Stealing Initiative</p>
			<p>Stealing Initiative is only and exclusively possible immediately before the first blows of any bout are 
			traded and is usually done in one of two circumstances: The first is when two combatants declare as aggressors 
			and attack simultaneously. If one combatant turns out to be fractionally slower than the other, he may attempt 
			to Steal Initiative, but if both combatants attack at exactly the same time, the combatant with the higher 
			Reflex score is the one first entitled to attempt to Steal Initiative; tied Reflex scores are broken by the 
			higher CG score, and tied CG scores by the higher Proficiency. Should he decline to try Stealing Initiative, 
			the other combatant may then opt to attempt to.</p>
			
			<p>The party attempting to Steal Initiative pays an Activation Cost equal to half his opponent’s SY (0.50 
			rounds up). The attempt itself is an Opposed Check between the initiator’s CG and his opponent’s DG.</p>
			
			<p>This contest is modified by differences in the Reach of the weapons used; if there is any difference, the 
			wielder of the longer weapon receives a flat +1 die bonus on his Check while the wielder of the shorter weapon 
			must incur a flat -1 die penalty. When the combatants begin the bout already at the Reach of the shorter of 
			the weapons involved, the above modifiers are reversed: Shorter weapons garner a flat +1 die bonus, and 
			longer weapons a flat -1 die penalty.</p>
			
			<p>Finally, the initiator of the attempt, and only he, may buy bonus dice for his Check by spending dice from 
			his MP on a one-to-one basis, up to the value of his DG rating. PAs do not modify to this check, as PAs are 
			added to one’s MP pool at the beginning of the combat scene, and are thus already accounted for.</p>
			
			<p>The winner of the Opposed Check strikes first, and the loser, should he still be able to continue after his 
			opponent’s attack, second. In a tie, both combatants strike simultaneously, which might well result in the 
			death of both. In any case, a combatant who had the Initiative stolen from him may immediately try to steal it 
			back. Such attempts to Steal Initiative or steal it back may theoretically continue until one party depletes 
			his MP. wish to Steal Initiative can occur when a character who has previously declared defense wishes to 
			switch over and instead attack. The process is identical to that described above.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_Surprise">Surprise</p>
			<p>Surprise can occur at any time, even when you suspect that danger is near. When a Surprise Check is called 
			for, the player checks Reflex against TN7, with the difficulty based on how alert the character or NPC was. 
			Table 14, Surprise Challenge Levels, provides guidelines. Failure indicates no action can be taken until the 
			next Combat Round.</p>
			
			<p>Meeting the required number of Successes means that the target may defend themselves (or attempt to Steal 
			Initiative).</p>

			<p class="h4" id="P_TheExchange">4. Steps 3 & 5: The Exchange</p>
			<p>Again, each Combat Round consists of two Exchanges. During an Exchange each of the participants may perform 
			but one action, usually attacking or defending by use of a single one of either the Offensive or Defensive 
			Maneuvers.</p>
			
			<p>One who is in the role of aggressor may utilize both Offensive and Defensive Maneuvers, though will of 
			course usually not choose one of the latter. One who is in the role of defender may freely utilize nothing but 
			Defensive Maneuvers, but may choose to execute an Offensive Maneuver instead if he pays a special Activation 
			Cost (see below).</p>
			
			<p>All attacks must be aimed at a specific locale, numbered 1-14 on the Target Zone diagrams. Arrows indicate 
			swing Target Zones, while circles mark Target Zones for thrusting or missile attacks. While a player need not 
			declare a specific number, he must describe the attack in terms that may be easily understood, i.e., Thrust to 
			the face, Slash to the right foot, etc.), as random attacks are not a part of Blade melee. Maneuvers and chosen 
			Target Zones may increase or decrease TNs for both attacker and defender alike, and may also require an 
			additional Activation Cost: Optionally, all melee thrusts to head and limbs (Target Zones 8, 9, 13, and 14) 
			require an additional 1-point Activation Cost to execute.</p>
			
			<p>Both participants now roll the allotted Dice from their Melee Pool (See Step 2), with all modifiers totaled 
			from all Maneuvers, stances, or other situations factors. This is a normal Opposed Check, where one party’s 
			Victories are subtracted from the other’s, leaving the winner with a net QoS. An attack may potentially cause 
			damage only if the attacker achieves a QoS of 1 or more. Ties in the Opposed Check or an outright QoS in the 
			defender’s favor means no damage was inflicted.</p>
			
			<p>All Target Numbers for this Check come from the ATN (Attack Target Number, used when attacking) or DTN 
			(Defense Target Number, used when defending) listed with each weapon (see the Appendix) or defence. After all 
			damage is resolved, a winning aggressor maintains his role as aggressor, unless he declines it, or cannot 
			continue because of depleted MP, while conversely his opponent still retains uncommitted MP dice. If either is 
			the case, the defender may choose to take on the role of aggressor.</p>
			
			<p>With a successful net QoS, the defender may now take on the role of aggressor, unless he merely tied the 
			aggressor, in which case the latter retains his role.</p>
			
			<p>Note that some Defensive Maneuvers may on a case-by-case basis allow a successful defender to either assume 
			the role of aggressor upon a tie, or upon paying an additional Activation Cost, or perhaps under no 
			circumstances at all. Any such special mechanics are explained within their respective Maneuvers.</p>
			
			<p>Finally, should a defender enter a new Exchange and wishes to execute an Offensive Maneuver and attack, 
			regardless of the consequences, he may declare an Offensive Maneuver like the aggressor, announcing both his 
			Maneuver for the Exchange and the number of dice allocated to it. This declaration of an Offensive Maneuver 
			carries an Activation Cost equal to half the aggressor’s DG (0.50 rounds up, as always), above and beyond any 
			normal Activation Cost for the Offensive Maneuver.</p>
			
			<p>In such circumstances, the aggressor resolves his Maneuver first and only then does the defender resolve 
			his Offensive Maneuver, should he still have the required dice in his MP to do so. Sneaking in an attack does 
			not in itself turn the previous defender into the aggressor; he still begins the next Exchange as the defender, 
			and his opponent the aggressor. However, should the defender manage to inflict a higher Wound Level upon the 
			aggressor than he received himself, he now assumes the role of aggressor.</p>
			
			<p>Visibility has a profound effect on combat. In dim lighting (for example, dusk) deduct 1 die from all Melee 
			Pools. During hours of darkness (moonlight) reduce all MPs to ¾. In pitch black conditions drop all MPs to half 
			value. Archery Pools are affected twice as severely as MPs. Deduct 2 dice from all Archery Pools for dim 
			lighting and drop it to half value for darkness. In pitch black conditions, all Archery Pools are at 0 
			dice.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_Reach">Weapon Reach</p>
			<p>Weapon Reach plays an enormous role in any combat. Weapon Reach is in six distinct Steps:</p>
			
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Hand</strong>: Fists, daggers, knee-strikes, grappling, etc.</li>
				<li><strong>Short</strong>: Long daggers, short swords, maces, etc.</li>
				<li><strong>Medium</strong>: Arming swords, ball-and-chains, sabers, short spears, etc.</li>
				<li><strong>Long</strong>: Hand-and-a-half swords, rapiers, spears, short polearms, etc.</li>
				<li><strong>Very Long</strong>: Greatswords, long polearms, etc.</li>
				<li><strong>Extremely Long</strong>: Lances, pikes, etc.</li>

			<p>Engaging the wielder of a longer weapon is conducted at -1 MP penalty for each Reach increment (Hand to 
			Short, Short to Medium, etc.) the attacker needs to close; the extreme case of engaging a pike man with bare 
			fists would carry a penalty of 5 MP. This penalty holds until the shorter weapon makes a damaging strike, after 
			which the penalty transfers to the longer weapon until he scores a damaging blow, when again the penalty goes 
			to the shorter weapon. When the shorter weapon is out of range this penalty applies only to attacks; when the 
			longer weapon is penalized, it applies to both offense and defense. Often the best course of action for long 
			weapons is to use a full evasion in the event of sudden close combat, or to drop weapons and wrestle! Certain 
			maneuvers (such as the Half-sword) are particularly effective in such situations.</p>
			
			<p>Likewise, many weapons—such as spears and other two-handed weapons— may shorten their reach. Botching in 
			combat is left for the referee to introduce as Complications at dramatic moments, to spice up events, increase 
			tension, and put pressure on the PCs. Still, if a group absolutely feels it has to have a mechanic for random 
			botches, this optional rule can be used:</p>
			
			<p><em>When an attack or defence comes up with 0 Successes, a botch results. No Complication arises from this 
			botch, but the character’s MP for the remainder of the Combat Round, or the following Combat Round if the 
			botch occurs on the second Exchange, is reduced by the number of dice rolled on the botched Check. In addition, 
			if the botched roll was made with 5+ dice, something else detrimental also happens. The exact nature of this 
			fumble is up to the referee, but most likely occurrences are the weapon breaking or slipping from the 
			character’s hand, or the character slipping and falling.</em></p>

			<p class="h4" id="P_Damage">5. Steps 4 & 6: Damage</p>
			<p>Should an attacker have one or more Successes over his opponent then the attack has landed (see Steps 3 & 5) 
			and a D6 is rolled to determine the specific location within the Target Zone (i.e. 1-14, as per the Target 
			Zone diagrams). Normally a lower roll means a lower hit and a higher roll a higher hit. A character can exert 
			some control over exactly where this blow lands by paying an additional activation cost before launching his 
			attack. Spending 1 additional die from his MP allows him to modify the d6 roll for the exact hit location 
			within Target Zone by +/– 1; an additional 2 dice (i.e. a total of 3) purchases a modifier of up to +/– 2, 
			and further 3 dice, for a maximum of 6 dice achieves a modifier of up to +/– 3.</p>
			
			<p><em>Note that a player need not use his full modifier, but may use it in part or none at all. Damage is 
			calculated by adding the Quality of Success (QoS) from the attack roll, (after defence Successes have been 
			subtracted), to the Damage Rating (DR) of the weapon used.</em></p>
			
			<p>The Damage Ratings for the various types of attacks possible with a weapon are found in the Weapon Tables 
			in the Appendix and will often fall in a range of –2 to +3. To this value, half the attacker’s BN (rounded up 
			for .50 or higher) is then added. This represents muscle power put behind the attack, the overall toughness 
			and muscle mass protecting the body from serious injury (with a bit of good fortune). This creates a subtotal, 
			or Impact Rating. From this Impact Rating, half the defender’s BN (again, .50 or higher rounds up) is 
			subtracted, representing a mixture of grit, health, and muscle mass protecting the vitals.</p>
			
			<p>Last, if the defender is wearing armor at the location hit, its Armor Value (AV) is subtracted from the 
			Impact Rating to arrive at a final damage number. This damage number is the Wound Level. For every wound’s 
			location and severity, there will be a corresponding entry rendering a few words describing the wound 
			accompanied by several numeric values.</p>
			
			<p>Wound Levels are rated from 1 to 6. A level 1 wound is usually a bruise, scratch or minor cut with no 
			notable adverse effects. Wounds of level 2 and 3 are worse, but hardly debilitating, while a level 4 wound is 
			quite a serious matter that will, more likely than not, decide the fight against the wounded person.</p>
			
			<p>While level 4 wounds are very debilitating, those of level 5 and 6 are lethal either immediately, because of 
			massive bleeding, or with other consequences, eventually fatal.</p>
			
			<div class="panel-body bg-warning" id="DIV_Example_Limelights">
				<p><em><strong>Example</strong>: Otho’s weapon has a Damage Rating of 2, and the wound that Otho inflicted 
				on Olaf has a sub-total (or Impact Rating) of 11. Rolling the location on a D6, we reference a direct hit 
				by Otho to Olaf’s unprotected neck!</p>
				
				<p>Having no armor at this location, Olaf may only subtract half his BN (5) from the Impact Rating... 
				11 - 3 (2.5 rounded up) = 8. This value of 8 defaults down to a level 6 wound, a Wound Level which 
				indicates the complete decapitation of Olaf’s head!</em></p>
			</div>
			
			<br/>
			
			<p>Location always makes a difference with wounds – a stab to an offhand will be much less damaging than the 
			same level stab wound to the belly, and a well-placed cut to the throat can be deadly at even low Wound Levels. 
			Wound Levels are not cumulative, even from multiple wounds to the exact same location. Each wound and all 
			consequences from the wound description are recorded separately, and while the consequences of wounds may 
			add up (see below), many small wounds do not combine into one larger wound. To kill somebody, a solid injury 
			is needed, not many very minor ones.</p>
			
			<p>Of course, a number of minor wounds may well – and often will – accumulate and thus handicap a fighter so 
			that his enemy is likely to drive home that one telling hit needed to dispatch him. Barring more esoteric 
			forms of damage such as sorcery, the most common are listed below.</p>
