			<p class="h2">Health, Healing, and Wounds</p>
			<p>In <em>Blade</em>, even a slight wound is no laughing matter. For the healing process to begin in earnest, 
			there are some mandates:</p>
			
			<p>First, you must be in a state of rest. Second, at least for the more serious wounds, you need some form of 
			treatment. Wounds can be tended to by anyone possessing the Healing Skill. Note that each wound must be 
			treated individually. A successful Healing Skill Check reduces Blood Loss by 3 per Success. A failed Healing 
			Check increases Blood Loss by 1, while a Botched Healing Check doubles the wound’s BL.</p>

		<div class="panel-body">
			<p class="h4">Dealing with Bloodloss</p>
			<p>As introduced in chapter four, at the very end of the Limelight in which the character first acquired BL, 
			and on the end of each subsequent Limelight, he must check BN. This Check must yield Successes equal to or 
			surpassing the current Blood Loss number.</p>
			
			<p>With that in mind, any Limelight Blood Loss Check made while the subject is at rest (or at most, moving or 
			walking very slowly), requires one less Success than indicated by the current Blood Loss rating to be 
			successful. This includes characters unconscious from BL. However, even if a character’s Blood Loss rating is 
			reduced to 0, the penalties accrued due to bleeding will not diminish immediately. Such penalties are reduced 
			by 2 for MP, Archery Pool and SP for each passing day spent resting with proper nourishment and low activity, 
			or by 1 per passing day of exertion.</p>
			
			<p>Any Wound Level beyond 2 calls for a chirurgeon (someone with the Healing Skill at level 3 or higher). At 
			the end of each week make a TY Check vs. the Pain rating of each individual wound. Each Success lowers that 
			wound’s Pain value by 1. This Check is modified by three things: Rest, medical care, and damage type.</p>
			
			<p>During convalescence, moderate activity with no more than one or two instances of strenuous activity is 
			assumed. If a character spends a week completely at rest, with no more than occasional light activity, the TY 
			Check for each injury is made against a TN of (Pain -1). On the other hand, if he doesn’t take it easy, this 
			TN is (Pain +1).</p>
			
			<p>A caregiver character using the Healing Skill and being available throughout much of the week of healing 
			time may make a Skill Check before the patient rolls. Each Success in this Check lowers the difficulty of all 
			patient healing Checks for this week by 1. Failure adds nothing, but if not a single Success is achieved on 
			the Skill Check, all the patient’s healing Checks for the week are made at +2 TN.</p>
			
			<p>Damage type — meaning Cleaving, Piercing, or Blunt— affect this TY Check as well. To heal a Blunt wound, the 
			basic TN is equal to Pain, but Piercing or Cleaving injuries heal with a basic TN of Pain +1.</p>

			<p class="h4" id="P_FallingDamage">Falling Damage</p>
			<p>Falling is defined as the free descent by force of gravity. All damage derived from falling is a result of 
			both the distance fallen and the surface landed upon. See the following table.</p>
			
			<p class="h4">Falling Damage Table</p>
			<table class="table table-striped table-hover" id="TBL_FallingDamage">
				<thead>
					<th>Landing Surface</th>
					<th>Damage Rating</th>
				</thead>
				<tbody>
					<tr>
						<td>Soft; a large pile of hay, a featherbed, water (with a successful Swimming check)</td>
						<td>One per Three Meters fallen</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Mixed; a crowd of people, falling (not diving) into shallow water, muddy banks</td>
						<td>One per Two Meters fallen</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Hard; ground, stone, armoured people falling from horses, water (with a failed Swimming 
						check)</td>
						<td>One per Meter fallen</td>
					</tr>
				</tbody>
			</table>
			
			<p>All damage caused by the fall is considered to be Blunt damage. Damage is randomly assigned to some location 
			on the recipient’s body; for every two points of damage suffered, roll once on the following table and assign 
			damage accordingly. Damage to any area rolled more than once is cumulative and applied with a single d6 roll on 
			the Target Zone Charts (See Appendices).</p>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_AllocateFallDamage">Allocation of Falling Damage</p>
			<table class="table table-striped table-hover" id="TBL_AllocateFallDamage">
				<thead>
					<th>d12 Roll</th>
					<th>Area Location</th>
				</thead>
				<tbody>
					<tr>
						<td>1 - 2</td>
						<td>One</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>3 - 4</td>
						<td>Two</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>

					<tr>

					</tr>
				</tbody>
			</table>
			
			<p>Only the longest of falls can affect more than one Target Zone. The number of Zones the damage can be spread 
			to can never be higher than two, or one quarter the fall’s height in meters, which ever is greater. As soon as 
			this number of Zones has been derived from rolls on Table 5.4, further damage is assigned randomly to the Zones 
			already determined.</p>
			
			<div class="panel-body bg-warning" id="DIV_Example_Falling">
				<p><em><strong>Example</strong>: Otho is knocked from his horse. The fall from the saddle corresponds to a 
				fall of 2m to the hard ground. Consulting Table 5.3, we see that’s a hard fall. He then rolls 3 and 4 on a 
				D12. Consulting Table 5.4 we note that Otho takes a level two Blunt wound to his upper leg (area 2). He 
				now must roll 1D6 on the Damage Table in the Appendices to determine the exact location of the 
				injury.</em></p>

			<p class="h4" id="P_GenericDamage">Generic Damage</p>
			<p>Any damage from fire, cold, electricity, sorcery, the elements, or not specifically covered by rules uses 
			the “Generic Damage” chart in the Appendix. Such damage is calculated like damage from any other attack 
			described in chapter four. Such damage is applied randomly using Table 5.4, unless impacting a specific area 
			(such as someone with a flaming arrow, in which case any fire damage is simply applied to the area 
			struck).</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_Poison">Poison</p>
			<p>When a character is poisoned, he must pass frequent Checks to avoid advancing along the six levels of the 
			Poison Track, which, much like the six Wound Levels of melee combat, are progressive in their severity. Should 
			he advance to Poison Level 6, he dies. The frequency of such “Progression” Checks (using the Knockout 
			Attribute) depends on how fast the poison acts. Such can either be:</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>A Limelight</li>
				<li>A few minutes</li>
				<li>Half an hour</li>
				<li>A few hours</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>Ingested poisons generally have a progression rate of one half hour to several hours, unless sorcerous by 
			nature, in which case they may have a progression time of only a few minutes.</p>
			
			<p>Injected poisons generally have a progression rate of a few minutes to one half hour, but if injected to the 
			head, neck or torso, become faster by one “step”. In such cases, a progression rate of but a single Limelight 
			is possible. To successfully inject a poison, no Wound Levels need be inflicted. For as long as the poison 
			attack’s Impact Rating surpasses the victim’s Armor Value, the poison is successfully injected, even if BN 
			soaks up all actual damage.</p>
			
			<p>To avoid advancing along the Poison Track, a Progression Check must be passed. This Check’s required amount 
			of successes is dependent on the strength of the poison being resisted. Such Checks typically must yield either 
			QoS 2 or 3. Poisons requiring QoS 1 certainly exist and are indeed much more common than the more virulent 
			ones, but their progression is hardly dramatic enough to bother with at all.</p>
			
			<p>Conversely, poisons necessitating QoS 4 or greater are possible, but so sublimely deadly that referees are 
			strongly advised to have them appear more as a threat of something to avoid at all costs, rather than something 
			to actually afflict on the PCs.</p>
			
			<p>Medical aid can be provided to the afflicted by any character with either the Apothecary or the Healing 
			Skill. A successful Apothecary Check with a Challenge Level equalling the virulence of the poison (i.e. the QoS 
			required by the Knockout Check to avoid further progression on the Poison Track) will lower the TN of further 
			Progression Checks by 1.</p>
			
			<p>A Check using the Healing Skill brings the same benefit, but instead must meet a Challenge Level equal to 
			twice the poison’s virulence. Once a character has passed three successive poison Progression Checks, further 
			advancement on the Poison Track is arrested and the character has “ridden out” the poisoning. From this point 
			on he must pass a Knockout Check every few hours at TN 7, with the poison recovery Challenge Level equal to the 
			poison’s current virulence.</p>
			
			<p>Successfully meeting this Check signifies one step back along the Poison Progression Chart (Table 25) and a 
			commensurate reduction to the poison’s recovery Challenge Level. This downward spiral of Checks continues until 
			the effects of the poisoning fade completely and the subject is hale once more.</p>

			<p class="h4" id="P_ItsJustAScratch">Pain - It's Just a Scratch! (Optional)</p>
			<p>The protagonists of Sword & Sorcery tales are notoriously tough. Whether because of an indomitable force of 
			will or just sheer machismo, they often shrug off hurt that would lay low lesser men. The same is true for PCs 
			and named NPCs in Blade.</p>
			
			<p>As soon as the action in a scene in which the character has received a wound subsides, the higher of either 
			BN or TY may be Checked for the character; (NOTE: PAs are not applied to this Check!). Once Checked, an amount 
			of Pain equaling the QoS of the successful Check may be subtracted from any newly inflicted wounds. The player 
			then decides how this QoS bonus is applied against those wounds, distributing Pain relief to any fresh wound as 
			desired.</p>
			
			<div class="panel-body bg-warning" id="DIV_Example_Falling">
				<p><em><strong>Example</strong>: Otho has 3 cuts received during the fight he just emerged from as victor:</p></em>
				
				<ul>
					<li>A Pain 1 cut to his hand</li>
					<li>A Pain 1 cut to his jaw</li>
					<li>A Pain 2 cut to his side</li>
				</ul>
				
				<p>Rolling a TN7 Check vs. Tenacity (His TY is higher than his BN) he scores 3 Successes and opts to reduce 
				the Pain 2 cut to his side down to zero, and to also get rid of the Pain 1 cut to his hand. The cut to his 
				jaw he opts to leave as a dueling scar for the ladies to admire!</em></p>
