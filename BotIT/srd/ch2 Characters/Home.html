			<p class="h2">Characters and Talents</p>
			<p>Characters in <em>Blade</em> are painted in broad strokes by their Talents. These Talents, 
			primarily Attributes, Skills, and Proficiencies, are used by the player as a metric of their Character’s 
			strengths and weaknesses.</p>
			
			<p>Players can and should consult the wide body of Sword & Sorcery literature available for their inspiration. 
			Joining in with their Ref and fellow players, they can then exchange ideas and work on creating character 
			histories (and Passions) that will work in harmony with the rest of the group’s goals and story direction.</p>
			
			<p>This is where the Talent table now comes into play. Our particular Blade Talent Table is comprised of six 
			Talents. While the described categories of Attributes, Skills, and Proficiencies form the heart of the entries 
			on the Blade Talent Table, there are many more possibilities that should be pondered.</p>
		</div>
	</div>
	<!-- Jumbotron ends here -->
	
	<!-- Content begins here -->
	<div class="container text-justify">
		<div class="panel-body">
			<p class="h4">I. Talents</p>
			<p>Much of the choices concerning the remaining three Talents will be based on both the setting, and the needs 
			and expectations of the gaming group involved. For example, one should be concerned with the question of if there 
			is to be sorcery in the setting. If so, to what degree? Will racial choices other than human be offered to 
			Players? These and many other questions once answered will give a referee his compass points when building his 
			own Talent Table.</p>
			
			<p>Having by now gotten a sense of the character that they wish to build stories around, players then translate 
			these ideas to <em>Blade</em> by selecting Talent levels based on their importance to the player’s vision of 
			their Character. Will the character be a man of fierce fighting ability? Or, perhaps a deft thief prowling the 
			rooftops of fantastic cities! Whatever the Player decides will be the prime focus of his Character warrants a 
			priority “A” or “B” pick.</p>
			
			<p>Next come aspects of the character that should still demonstrate competence or training. These will likely 
			merit a “C” or “D” pick. And last comes those picks that the player has determined are not of major concern to 
			his Blade experience, the “E” and “F” picks. For our included sample setting we’ve created a Talent table as an 
			example.</p>
			
			<div class="panel-body" id="DIV_Sorcery">
				<p class="h4">1. Sorcery</p>
				<p>The lands of the Sword & Sorcery campaign, though dominated by skillful swordsmen, are still yet haunted 
				by powerful sorcerers wielding their dark magic. The Sorcery Priority governs the relation of your 
				Character to the occult mysteries of the supernatural, whether your character is steeped in them, just a 
				regular guy, or victimized by those dark forces. If you plan on playing a non-sorcerer character, then 
				select either “Mundane” as your Priority D (the Average priority), or “Cursed” as your Priority E. 
				Selecting “Doomed” as your Priority F also gives you a character without sorcerous powers, but shouldn’t 
				be done lightly; the character is not likely to survive this choice.</p>
				
				<p>If you want to play any type of wielder of arcane powers, chose Sorcery as your Priority A, B, or C, 
				but choose carefully as <strong>the sorcerous Mysteries to which those Picks give your character access are 
				all he will ever be able to learn</strong>; no sorcerer can ever learn more Mysteries than those allowed by 
				his initial Sorcery Pick.</p>
				
				<p>Once you have made your choice, create a background that fits your concept, discussing your choice with 
				your fellow players and the ref. This gives others the chance to riff off your inspiration and create 
				character origins that will work well with your own.</p>
				
				<div class="panel-body" id="DIV_SorceryPicks">
					<p class="h4" id="P_Sorc_Mysteriarch">A : Mysteriarch</p>
					<p>A Mysteriarch is one of the greatest masters of the arcane alive. He can know all Mysteries, both 
					Lesser and Greater, and he starts out the game with knowledge of a single Arcane Secret. He receives 
					one free point in the Occultism Skill and one free Proficiency point to spend on Mysteries, but may not 
					put more Proficiency points into Greater than into Lesser Mysteries.</p>
					
					<p class="h4" id="P_Sorc_Sorcerer">B : Sorcerer</p>
					<p>Sorcerer denotes somebody deeply steeped and well versed in arcane knowledge. He can know either all 
					six Lesser Mysteries, or three Lesser and one Greater Mystery. He receives one free point in the 
					Occultism Skill.</p>
					
					<p>Should he opt for a Greater Mystery, it may be of no greater value than his highest Lesser 
					Mystery.</p>
					
					<p class="h4" id="P_Sorc_Dabbler">C : Dabbler</p>
					<p>Dabbler encompasses hedge wizards, witch doctors, sages of secret lore, some of the more devoted 
					cultists of unwholesome deities and other serious meddlers in the occult. Such characters may know up 
					to two Lesser Mysteries and may also have the Occultism Skill. Enslavement and Witchfire may not both 
					be chosen.</p>
					
					<p class="h4" id="P_Sorc_Mundane">D : Mundane</p>
					<p>Mundane denotes the common man. He has heard whispers of sorcery but has most likely never 
					encountered it, has no affinity for it, and most certainly doesn’t know any.</p>
					
					<p class="h4" id="P_Sorc_Cursed">E : Cursed</p>
					<p>Cursed denotes a person not only unskilled in the arcane, but also somehow particularly vulnerable 
					to harmful sorcery. When he checks to resist sorcerous harm or influence, he does so at a +2 
					Target Number penalty.</p>
					
					<p class="h4" id="P_Sorc_Doomed">F : Doomed</p>
					<p>Doomed is a person not only devastatingly open to harmful sorcery, but actually victimized by it. He 
					resists sorcery as per the E Pick, Cursed (at a +2 Target Number penalty), and on top of this has 
					already contracted some kind of terrible supernatural doom or weird. This doom hanging over him is 
					geared toward a specific, utterly ruinous fate, expressing itself in mechanical terms as the equivalent 
					of a Curse Rating six (See the Cursing Mystery), which can be lifted by neither faith or sorcery.</p>
					
					<p>This doom need not be geared toward PC death, but if it isn’t it needs to be geared to the utter 
					destruction of all the PC holds dear and wants to achieve. Whatever the doom may be, it must run its 
					course, undoing the PC in some nasty fashion. Alternatively, it might be remotely possible to lift by 
					means of an impossible quest. Such a quest should take up more than five game sessions devoted solely 
					to it, during which time the PC should face more than even odds of dying at least three times; in 
					short, the referee should make sure that such a quest fails more often than it succeeds.</p>
					
					<p>Please be advised that this Priority Pick should not be taken lightly, as the severity of the curse 
					will more likely than not result in the destruction of the PC before the quest to lift it can be 
					completed.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			
			<div class="panel-body" id="DIV_Culture">
				<p class="h4">2. Culture</p>
				<p>The protagonists of the Sword & Sorcery genre are often quite a bit darker than those of heroic fantasy 
				works like Tolkien’s Lord of the Rings. They tend to be outsiders or social outcasts, rejected or looked 
				down upon by the powers of the society they find themselves in. Sword and Sorcery also diverges sharply 
				from high fantasy in that non-humans such as elves and dwarves typically don’t exist, and both Player 
				Characters and Non-Player Characters are Human.</p>
				
				<p>The archetypes listed are not meant as “character classes” nor do they represent Human realities, but 
				rather are descriptive clichés of the genre, tropes that can be used to distinguish characters that 
				otherwise would have the same racial abilities. Both Asset and Skill choices for all archetypes should be 
				discussed and agreed upon by both the player and ref before either is assigned to the character.</p>
			
				<div class="panel-body" id="DIV_CulturePicks">
					<p class="h4" id="P_Cult_Enlightened">A : Enlightened</p>
					<p>A few great civilizations rise above others and gain near mythical status. Learned beyond normal 
					men, people of enlightened cultures are builders of cyclopean pyramids and towers that pierce the 
					skies. Their magnificent buildings can last forever, and likewise monuments to an enlightened one’s 
					achievement can withstand the passage of time. Enlightened characters are especially long lived and 
					begin play with these modifiers:</p>
					
					<ul>
						<li>+1 each to Tenacity, Sagacity and Heart; minimum 2, maximum 8/9</li>
						<li>One bonus supernatural or culture related Asset Occultism Skill always allowed</li>
						<li>Fourteen (14) bonus Skill points</li>
						<li>Enlightened Ones live half again to three times as long as mere mortals and need little to 
						no sustenance or sleep</li>
					</ul>
					
					<p class="h4" id="P_Cult_Savage">B : Savage</p>
					<p>Savages include warriors from the frozen north and witch-doctors from the trackless wastes of the 
					south. Savages tend to have a close connection with nature, but remain ignorant of many developments 
					that more civilized people take for granted. Savage characters begin play with these modifiers:</p>
					
					<ul>
						<li>+1 each to Brawn, Daring and Tenacity; minimum 2, maximum 8/9</li>
						<li>Seven (7) bonus Skill points related to Survival, Climbing, Animal Ken, etc.</li>
					</ul>
					
					<p class="h4" id="P_Cult_HillmanNomad">C : Hillman / Nomad</p>
					<p>Hillmen live in broken mountainous regions that are hard to traverse. Their homeland lies either at 
					the edge of civilized lands or is surrounded by them and might even be at least nominally part of a 
					civilized nation. But in any case, the isolation offered by their hills make Hillmen quite independent, 
					and it is not uncommon for them to sally forth from their mountain fastness to prey upon softer people, 
					forcibly collecting tribute from all who trespass their land.</p>
					
					<p>Nomads roam the empty wastes beyond the civilized cities; quick to strike, and bound by no laws. 
					Nomads live with their animals and usually ride into battle with them; they feel ill at ease without 
					them. Nomadic and Hillmen characters begin play with the following modifiers:</p>
					
					<ul>
						<li>Seven (7) bonus Skill points related to Survival, Climbing, Animal Ken, etc.</li>
					</ul>
					
					<p class="h4" id="P_Cult_Civilized">D : Civilized</p>
					<p>Savages and Hillmen eventually gather together to cultivate the land, build great cities, develop 
					trade, and study medicine, mathematics and languages. In the civilized lands dwell noble knights, wise 
					kings, and learned sages — as well as greedy merchants and cunning thieves. Civilized characters begin 
					play with no particular advantages or disadvantages.</p>
					
					<p class="h4" id="P_Cult_Decadent">E : Decadent</p>
					<p>Great civilizations reach their peak and eventually start to decline. Such fallen empires are ruled 
					by jaded nobles, corrupt priests and wicked slave-traders. Demon-worship, human sacrifice and drug 
					abuse is all too common in these cultures. Decadent characters begin play with the following 
					modifiers:</p>
					
					<ul>
						<li>-1 to Tenacity; minimum 1, maximum 7</li>
						<li>Either -1 to Brawn (minimum 1, maximum 7) or one Poor Asset related to mental handicaps like 
						Addiction, Sadism, etc.</li>
					</ul>
					
					<p class="h4" id="P_Cult_Degenerate">F : Degenerate</p>
					<p>The last survivors of decadent civilizations start to feud over dwindling resources, or are driven 
					away by stronger cultures. Fleeing into the wilderness, or deep underground beneath their ruins, they 
					start to inbreed and devolve into something no longer entirely human. Degenerates may outwardly 
					resemble savages, but they carry the evil taint of fallen empires. Degenerate characters begin play 
					with the following modifiers:</p>
					
					<ul>
						<li>-1 to three Attributes; minimum 1, maximum 7</li>
						<li>Two Poor Assets chosen by player, focused on bodily handicaps and gruesome mental illnesses 
						such as Necrophilia, Inhuman, etc.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
			</div>
			
			<div class="panel-body" id="DIV_Attributes">
				<p class="h4">3. Attributes</p>
				<p>Assigning points to your attributes is vital to constructing an exciting character. Each player is given 
				a number of points to distribute amongst the 6 Basic Attributes. Available points are determined by the 
				Priority level selected.</p>
				
				<p>These points you may assign as you will, with but two cautions: All players must nominate one of their 
				attributes as their “Focus.” No other attribute may exceed the point value of the “Focus” during the 
				process of character creation.</p>
				
				<p>In addition, no character should start with any Attribute at the unique level of 9. This level should be 
				reserved for development during play with others. Our example of character creation provides some thoughts 
				on the process of assignment of points to Basic Attributes.</p>
				
				<p>Next, work with your fellow players and ref to create your four Passion Attributes and fill them in on 
				your character sheet. Beginning Passion Attribute Points are the same for each beginning character: Seven 
				(7) points to be distributed between the four open Attributes and the fixed Drama Attribute. Any given 
				Passion Attribute may be as low as zero or as high as five.</p>
				
				<p>Combined Attributes are calculated by combining two or more existing attributes. These should be 
				calculated once all Basic and Passion Attributes are finalized. All numbers equal to or greater than .50 
				are rounded up.</p>
				
				<ul>
					<li>Reflex = (Cunning + Daring) / 2</li>
					<li>Aim = (Cunning + Sagacity) / 2</li>
					<li>Knockdown = (Brawn + Daring) / 2</li>
					<li>Knockout = (Brawn + Tenacity) / 2</li>
					<li>Move = (Brawn + Cunning + Daring) / 3</li>

				<p>Next, assign all available Skill points to those Skills you desire for your character. Again, available

				Skill at level 9. Pay close attention for any Sorcery, Cultural, or Asset modifiers to your Skills that you 
				may be entitled to, and once each Skill has been chosen; write those Skills down on your sheet.</p>

				the Priority level selected. Points may be distributed in any manner the player desires, though no 
				Proficiency may start out with the maximum rating of 13.</p>
				
				<p>Once you have your Proficiencies assigned, write down any associated Maneuvers or Mysteries (Both are 
				described in Chapters Three and Six respectively) on your character sheet.</p>

			<div class="panel-body" id="DIV_Assets">
				<p class="h4">6. Assets</p>
				<p>Assets are aspects of a character’s personality, background, or physique, that make him better at some 
				activities (Good) and worse at others (Poor), depending on which portion of the Asset is being explored. 
				In addition to their mechanical effects, Assets suggest characteristics about the character’s personality 
				that might lead to interesting role-playing opportunities.</p>
				
				<p>Assets offer a way for game mechanics to encourage deeper character backgrounds and more consistent 
				role-playing.</p>
				
				<p>Any character can begin play with up to six Good or three Poor Assets, chosen by the player at the time 
				of character creation, plus any other Assets the character may derive from other Picks such as Culture. On 
				top of the Good or Poor Assets gained from his Picks, a player may opt to choose one (and only one), 
				additional Good Asset for his character, if he balances this with a Poor Asset.</p>
				
				<p>When selecting your “Good” or “Poor” Asset keep in mind that the entire Asset (both Good and Poor) is 
				now yours to develop as you wish, but whatever form (again, Good or Poor) you initially selected it in will 
				be the aspect that you first focus your role-playing efforts on.</p>
				
				<div class="panel-body bg-warning" id="DIV_Example_Assets">			
					<p><em><strong>Example</strong>: Picture a Barbarian who arrives in his first big city, a character 
					that has begun the game with the Poor aspect of the “Uncivilized” Asset. He’s a savage man in civilized 
					surroundings and therefore his asset would initially be rather detrimental to him.</p>
					
					<p>But over time as he gradually gets accustomed to city life, he learns to better deal with his own 
					uncivilized nature - he then begins to develop the Good aspect of the Asset, which reflects how he has 
					learned to use his own savage nature to his advantage in certain situations!</p>
					
					<p>With the passing of yet more adventure time, while he is still every bit as uncivilized as he was in 
					the beginning (years before in some cases), he no longer suffers for it, and has apparently learned to 
					compensate for it in other ways. The “Uncivilized” portion of his nature is truly now an advantage for 
					him!</em></p>
				</div>
				
				<br/>
				
				<p>As soon as you feel that you have explored the current aspect of the Asset to your (and the group’s) 
				satisfaction and would like to expand your role-playing vision, please feel free to purchase the Asset’s 
				opposite side. You can then move between the two aspects of the Asset as desired. When no longer interested 
				in the Asset you can always buy it off.</p>
				
				<p><em><strong>Note that Poor Assets normally derived from the Culture Priority Pick can only be bought off 
				under exceptional circumstances, and only then if both the referee and the rest of the gaming group agree 
				that PC’s experiences warrant such a radical development.</strong></em></p>
