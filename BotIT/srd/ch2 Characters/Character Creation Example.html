			<p class="h2">Character Creation Tips</p>
			<p>The protagonists in sword-and-sorcery fiction are most often thieves, mercenaries, or 
			barbarians struggling not for worlds or kingdoms, but for their own gain or mere survival. They are rebels 
			against authority, skeptical of civilization and its rulers and adherents. A thoughtful back-story or biography 
			for your Blade character is the surest way to transform him from a two-dimensional figure to a fascinating and 
			exciting S&S hero.</p>
			
			<p>Hopefully, these character creation tips will help you in that process.</p>

		<div>
			<p class="h4">Step One</p>
			<p>Jot down some notes describing the variety of plotlines that you, as a player, would enjoy exploring. Ask 
			yourself what your character’s goals in such stories would be. What would they fight or die for? Later, you can 
			expand these thoughts by explaining why the character has these goals (What in his history led him to have these 
			goals? Do the character’s likes/dislikes have an influence on these goals?).</p>
			
			<p>Use any notes you come up with to generate your four Passion Attributes.</p>
			
			<div class="panel-body bg-warning" id="DIV_Example_StepOne">			
				<p><em>Paul wants a game based on greed, murder, and revenge. His character Otho will be a hood rat, one of 
				the city’s dregs, a sly street tough who nurses a grudge against the local crime lord who murdered his 
				mother years ago. His core motivations in life are revenge for his mother, and the acquisition of wealth. 
				He quickly decides all four of his Passions:</p>
				
				<ul>
					<li>Passion # 1 – Revenge on the gang boss who murdered my mother!</li>
					<li>Passion # 2 - Get the money!</li>
					<li>Passion # 3 - Keep my hide safe!</li>
					<li>Passion # 4 – Hatred for the rich!</li>
				</ul></em></p>
			</div>
			
			<br/>
			
			<p class="h4">Step Two</p>
			<p>While Sword & Sorcery protagonists are rarely lily-white, you should decide what kind of ethics or creed your 
			character lives or dies by.</p>
			
			<div class="panel-body bg-warning" id="DIV_Example_StepTwo">			
				<p><em>Otho is not too trustworthy and will exploit people and situations if profit is available (although 
				he doesn’t necessarily gain pleasure from such exploitation; it’s usually just a means to an end).</p>
				
				<p>When he sees an opportunity for gain he will jump right into it without too much thought, although he is 
				the opposite when danger arises. In battle he will tend to seek cover and fight only when confident that 
				he will have the upper hand, though if desperate he is capable of fighting with tiger-like 
				ferocity.</em></p>
			</div>
			
			<br/>
			
			<p class="h4">Step Three</p>
			<p>Determine the physical qualities of your character. This includes most of the things you will find on the 
			character sheet (Name, Culture, Attributes, Assets, Race, etc.). Many of these items will be imperative to 
			determining the history and tastes of your character.</p>
			
			<div class="panel-body bg-warning" id="DIV_Example_StepThree">			
				<p><em>Paul decides on the following order of Otho’s Talents:</p>
				
				<p>First, Paul selects Sorcery for his “F” pick, and decides that Otho is unaware of the nature of the 
				“Doom” that he lives under. Next, mulling over his choices on the Talent table, Paul selects his “E” 
				choice as “Decadent” since he feels this will best represent the horrid conditions that Otho grew up in. 
				This will limit his Tenacity to a maximum value of 7.</p>
				
				<p>Paul opts to take a Poor Asset instead of limiting his maximum Brawn value to 7 as well. Flipping over 
				to the Assets section of chapter three he selects the Poor aspect of <strong>Arrogance</strong>. This Poor 
				Asset reflects an area of Otho’s personality that Paul would like to explore; Otho’s temper and the 
				fragility of his ego. Having gotten his two toughest picks out of the way, Paul now selects “Proficiencies” 
				for his “D” pick, though this will limit him to only 6 Proficiency points initially. Paul wants to focus 
				his build on strong Attributes and a good selection of Skills. All 6 points go into the Cut & Thrust 
				Proficiency.</p>
				
				<p>To balance his Poor Asset, Paul opts to make his “C” priority a Good Asset. From chapter three he 
				selects the Good aspect of Cautious, again, a choice that well reflects Otho’s personality. On to “B”! 
				Paul now selects Skills for his “B” pick. This will give him 33 points to drop on Skills! He spends those 
				points in the following Skills:</em></p>
				
				<ul><strong>
					<li>Climbing : 6</li>
					<li>Disguise : 3</li>
					<li>Etiquette : 4</li>
					<li>Falsehood : 4</li>
					<li>Lock Picking : 3</li>
					<li>Information Gathering : 3</li>
					<li>Pick Pockets : 6</li>
					<li>Sneaking : 4</li>
				</strong></ul>
				
				<p><em>He now arranges his 34 points for the “A” Attribute pick as follows:</em></p>
				
				<ul><strong>
					<li>Brawn : 5</li>
					<li>Daring : 6</li>
					<li>Tenacity : 4 (5, -1 for Decadent)</li>
					<li>Sagacity : 4</li>
					<li>Heart : 6</li>
					<li>Cunning : 8</li>
				</strong></ul>
			</div>
			
			<br/>
			
			<p class="h4">Step Four</p>
			<p>Now you get to the environmental influences upon your character. Where did he grow up? What social class is 
			he? Who are/were some of the people closest to him (enemies, parents, friends, love interests, etc.)? Remember 
			that the physical and social environment a character grew and lives in has a huge effect on the philosophies of 
			that character.</p>
			
			<div class="panel-body bg-warning" id="DIV_Example_StepFour">			
				<p><em>Paul decides his character Otho is none too pleasant… Born in the worst slum area of the city, Otho 
				has only fragmented memories of his mother, a prostitute whom the gang lord murdered in a fit of rage when 
				Otho was but six years old. While he has no real friends, he has a healthy libido and can be flirtatious 
				and seductive when he feels confident; however, his lack of sincerity tends to put most women off.</p>
				
				<p>Socially, he tends to keep to himself and is evasive or deceitful about personal information. He 
				frequently seeks out strange and countercultural groups and situations, as long as his anonymity and 
				safety is assured.</em></p>
			</div>
			
			<br/>
			
			<p class="h4">Step Five</p>
			<p>Start to sculpt the personality of the character by starting out generally and gradually getting more 
			specific (Ex: Is your character more of a type A or type B personality? What does he like and fear? Does he 
			have any quirks? What are some of the secrets your character will have this adventure?)</p>
			
			<p>Keep in mind that fellow players and your referee can help you flesh out those final details and grow your 
			character, so don’t worry if you are having difficulty deciding on the specifics.</p>
			
			<div class="panel-body bg-warning" id="DIV_Example_StepFive">			
				<p><em>Otho is a generally anxious person and the idea of having wealth is comforting, and wealth he will 
				need if he is to escape the city if he manages to kill or rob the gang boss who slew his mother. In all, 
				he is a tough-minded fellow with a bleak and cynical view of the world.</p>
				
				<p>He is generally adaptable to changing situations and doesn’t hold allegiances or promises too tightly. 
				He is self-absorbed, greedy, and suspicious of others and has a cold bearing — he is quickly defensive and 
				critical. His sense of humor is dry, subtle, and under-the-radar. When he does talk, it is usually about 
				money or complaining about something; when he thinks there is potential gain, he will engage in ham-fisted 
				flattery.</p>
				
				<p>Although he loathes people who are socially or financially successful, he is too anxious to act openly 
				outside the boundaries of acceptable behavior; his transgressions are covert.</em></p>
			</div>
			
			</br>
			
			<p class="h4">Step Six</p>
			<p>Move on to constructing the history of your character. What has happened to him to make him the person 
			he is today?</p>
			
			<div class="panel-body bg-warning" id="DIV_Example_StepSix">			
				<p><em>Growing up under the worst of circumstances, Otho has mastered both the fine arts of pick pocketing 
				and lock picking as a way of surviving in an uncaring world. He will most often be found haunting the 
				market and great caravanserai of the city center.</p>
				
				<p>A harsh life has taught him to trust no one, nor to grow too attached to any person or place, though if 
				his loyalty was ever earned it would be frightening in its intensity.</em></p>
			</div>
			
			<br/>
			
			<p class="h4">Step Seven</p>
			<p>Lastly, it is up to both you and your referee to graft your character’s history to those plot elements that 
			will in turn bind the new character to the Blade campaign.</p>
			
			<p>Was your character somehow wronged by a principal antagonist in one of the ongoing plot arcs? Was your 
			character simply out to help himself or his people, or was he simply swept up into the adventure? Having 
			finished the history and personality of your character, this should be a rather simple thing to do working 
			alongside your referee.</p>
			
			<div class="panel-body bg-warning" id="DIV_Example_StepSeven">			
				<p><em>Both Paul and the referee determine that one plot arc of the upcoming game will revolve around the 
				great shipment of coin that the local gang boss annually moves out of the city.</p>
				
				<p></em>Even getting information on the timetable of the coin’s movement will be extremely dangerous. Otho 
				will most certainly need allies in order to successfully hit the crime lord’s money train.</p>
