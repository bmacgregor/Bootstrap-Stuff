			<p class="h2">What is a Role-playing Game?</p>
			<p>Role-playing is about being creative and having fun. It involves getting together with friends to write a 
			story, perhaps joining around a campfire or a dining room table to spin some tall tales. Role-Playing Games 
			(RPGs) are stories in which you create one of the main characters and the story around that character. The rest 
			of the Players create stories around their own characters. The “Referee” (or more simply “Ref”) brings those 
			stories together. The Referee can be thought of as the “director” of the story. In most RPGs, the Referee 
			will - with input from you, if you desire to give any - describe a world or setting. You and your friends will 
			play the protagonists and characters of this world, guiding your Characters through the story that you and your 
			friends create. Each Player plays a different Character, and each Character interacts with each of the other 
			Characters. Role-playing, in this sense, is very much play-acting in the mind. You imagine what the Referee 
			describes. Then you imagine your Character’s response to that situation, and describe that to the Ref and the 
			other Players. They, in turn, each do the same with their Characters.</p>

			<p class="h3">What is a Role-playing Game? (Continued)</p>
			<p>In most games – board games, card games, and dice games – there is a clearly defined way to win and a 
			clearly defined way to lose. Typically, winning is the goal of the game. In Role-Playing Games, the concepts 
			of “winning” and “losing” do not exist. Your goal as a Player is to help create a story and to have fun. You 
			may give your Character other goals, but the success of your Character does not determine any sense of 
			“winning” or “losing.”</p>
			
			<p>Like life, it’s not so much whether you win or lose, but how you play the game. <em>That’s all well and good,
			</em>you say, <em>but what actually goes on? What do these “Characters” do?</em> Most of the time, Characters 
			are involved in adventures; adventures of the type that are immortalized in adventure movies and serial novels. 
			In one game, the Characters might be a group of secret agents trying to save the world from nuclear destruction.
			In another, you might play a rebel force trying to overthrow an evil star-spanning empire. You might play a 
			group of warriors in eleventh century Europe, or King Arthur’s knights, or Superman, or Batman, or an original 
			Character of your own creation - in any world you choose. Like all games and many RPGs, <em>Blade of the Iron 
			Throne</em> involves elements of chance, skill, and strategy. These three elements are tightly related.</p>
		
			<hr/>
		
			<p class="h3">What kind of RPG is <em>Blade of the Iron Throne?</em></p>
			<p><em>Blade of the Iron Throne</em> (hereafter <em>Blade</em>) is an amalgamation of a number of different 
			game system mechanics, a blend of new and old school gaming sensibilities. It is also very much a game 
			grounded in tales of Sword & Sorcery (S&S) fiction.</p>
			
			<p>Sword & Sorcery is a sub-genre of fantasy fiction, taking its name from the sword-slinging adventurers, who 
			generally make up the genre’s protagonists, and the sorcery-using characters, who are often the villains and/or 
			antagonists. Common to Sword & Sorcery stories is the mindset of the main character. The Sword & Sorcery hero 
			is always a man (or woman) of action. He may be very intelligent and given to brooding and pondering (e.g. Kull 
			of Valusia), but when a situation requires a response, he does not hesitate or procrastinate endlessly. 
			He acts.</p>
			
			<p>In Sword & Sorcery stories, the world is an intrinsically harsh and tragic place. People’s lives are ruined 
			or even terminated left and right. Just to survive, much less prosper, in this harsh world, the protagonist 
			has to display a fair degree of harshness herself.</p>
			
			<p>However, a defining characteristic of Sword & Sorcery is that even a quite wicked Sword & Sorcery hero has 
			an unofficial and informal code; one that does not allow him to cross the line and treat unfairly friends and 
			companions, people he has shared danger with, and even respected enemies. Indeed, some he treats with 
			consideration and kindness. The most vicious Sword & Sorcery hero adheres to this code; it separates him from 
			the villains. A Sword & Sorcery villain will cross the line - that’s what makes him a villain.</p>
			
			<p><em>(See <a href="../ch7 SnS Gaming/Home.html">Chapter Seven – S&S Gaming</a>, for more information on 
			running a Sword & Sorcery campaign using <strong>Blade</strong>.)</em></p>
			
			<hr/>
				
			<p class="h3" id="P_DiceUsed">Basic Rules - Checks</p>
			<p class="h4">I. Dice Types Used</p>
			<p>Most of the time in old-style gaming, you don’t use a rule; you make a ruling. The Players can describe any 
			action without needing to look at a Character sheet to see if they “can” do it. The Referee, in turn, uses 
			common sense to decide what happens or rolls a die only if she thinks there’s some random element involved. When 
			needed, <em>Blade</em> uses two types of dice during play, twelve-sided dice (D12) and six-sided dice (D6). 
			These may be easily purchased online or at your local game store. References throughout this book refer to 
			twelve-sided dice unless otherwise noted.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4">II. The Major Checks</p>
			<p>In <em>Blade</em>, Checks are made by rolling an appropriate number of dice for the Attribute or Skill level 
			being tested against a fixed Target Number (TN) of seven (7). The number of successes needed for both Attribute 
			and Skill Checks are drawn from the following table.</p>
				
			<div class="panel-body" id="TBL_SuccessesNeeded">
				<p class="h4"><strong>Successes Needed</strong></p>
				<table class="table table-striped table-hover">
					<thead>
						<th>Successes</th>
						<th>Challenge Level *</th>
					</head>
					<tbody>

							<td>One</td>
							<td>Average</td>

						<tr>
							<td>Four</td>
							<td>Amazing</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>Five</td>
							<td>Legendary</td>

					</tbody>
				</table>
			</div>
			<p><strong>* If the applicable dice pool is more than three times the required number of successes, no roll is 
			needed, instead the character is considered to have achieved the amount of successes</strong></p>
				
			<p>Only dice rolled that meet or exceed the Target Number of seven (7) are successes. With the exception of 
			Proficiency and Mystery Checks, all Checks are made vs. Target Number seven (TN7) unless modified by Assets. 
			Quality of Success may also denote an action’s degree of success as indicated in the following table.</p>
		
			<div class="panel-body" id="TBL_QualityOfSuccess">
				<p class="h4"><strong>Quality of Success</strong></p>

			<p>While only one success is normally needed for an action to be successful, some actions at the Ref’s 
			discretion may be tasked with additional success requirements. One example could be a Player Character 
			attempting to pick a lock while pressed for time:</p>
		
			<div class="panel-body bg-warning" id="DIV_Exaple_SuccessRequirements">
				<p><em><strong>Ref: </strong>You want to pick this lock? That would normally be only Average, but to do it 
				in time is Challenging. You’re going to need two successes. Getting no successes will mean things get 
				complicated! (See the section on <a href="#P_Complications">Complications</a> later in this 
				chapter)</em></p>
				
				<p><em><strong>Player: </strong>Damn! I don’t have Lock Picking as a skill! Can I try it using that 
				lock-pick Otho gave me?</em></p>
				
				<p><em><strong>Ref: </strong>Sure - but it’ll be tougher since you don’t know what you’re doing. Now you’re 
				going to need four successes. And any result of two or less successes will earn you a Complication.</em></p>
				
				<p>In this example one success would normally achieve the task (opening the lock), but an additional 
				success is required to achieve the intended result (opening it before something else happens), for a total 
				of two successes.</p>
			</div>
		
			<br/>
		
			<p<strong>Attempting a task as an Attribute Check instead of a Skill Check, as required, <em>doubles</em> the 
			number of to required successes</strong>. <em>Blade</em> follows the idea that one action requires one Check. 
			There are five basic types of Checks:</p>
		
			<div class="panel-body" id="P_AttributeChecks">
				<p class="h4">1. Attribute Checks</p>
				
				<p><strong>Attribute Checks</strong> are made with a die pool derived from an Attribute level. They 
				represent tasks attempted with one’s natural, inborn ability - one’s talent - with abilities one has picked 
				up along the way without formal training.</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="panel-body" id="P_SkillChecks">
				<p class="h4">2. Skill Checks</p>
				<p><strong>Skill Checks</strong> are tests made with a die pool derived from a Skill level. Skills reflect 
				a Character’s aptitude in a trained, acquired pursuit. The degree of capability a Character can attain 
				through training is limited by his talent for it. <strong>Thus when using a Skill, a character’s Skill dice 
				pool may never be as high or higher than twice the value of the Attribute that would be most applicable for 
				the task attempted</strong>.</p>
				
				<p>For example, Cunning three (3) means that you can use no more than five (5) dice from the Lock Picking 
				Skill in any situation, if Cunning would be the most appropriate Attribute Checked for the situation.</p>
				
				<p>Conversely, Characters unskilled in a particular discipline work at a strong disadvantage compared to 
				their skilled counterparts. They may attempt the Check by using the most closely corresponding Attribute 
				instead of the Skill, but <strong>require twice as many successes as somebody knowing the Skill 
				would</strong>.</p>
				
				<div class="panel-body bg-warning" id="DIV_Example_SkillCheck">
					<p><em><strong>Example</strong>: Otho wants to accomplish a task requiring the Animal Ken Skill, but is 
					untrained in it. He has a Heart of six (6) and therefore may use it for the Check instead. If someone 
					skilled in Animal Ken would normally need two (2) successes to succeed at a specific Animal Ken Check, 
					Otho would instead need four (4).</em></p>
				</div>
				
				<br/>
				
				<p>Attribute and Skill values range from one (1) to eight (8), with <em>one</em> Skill and one Attribute at 
				level nine (9) allowed <strong>per Player or NPC. While no two PCs may have a score of nine in the same 
				Attribute or Skill</strong>, NPCs are not bound by this stricture and thus may have the same Skill or 
				Attribute at level nine that his Player counterpart enjoys. However, <em>for each Attribute or Skill there 
				may only be a single NPC per campaign who has this Attribute or Skill at level nine. If this NPC dies or 
				otherwise leaves the campaign, he may not be replaced by another NPC with a score of nine in that Attribute 
				or Skill for the rest of the campaign.</em></p>
				
				<p>Skill Check Challenge Levels should always frame the task in terms of how hard it is for someone who 
				does it all the time. They are invariably vs. Target Number seven (TN7), unless modified by an Asset.</p>
				
				<div class="panel-body bg-warning" id="DIV_Example_HardSkillCheck">			
					<p><em><strong>Example</strong>: Having gained admission to the radja’s dinner ball, Otho prowls the 
					halls in search for his intended pickpocket victim. The Ref advises that the society vultures are 
					unusually acerbic tonight and that Otho will have to bluff his way through several social encounters 
					before locating the victim. He declares drawing no attention whatsoever to him a Challenging (two 
					successes needed) feat of Etiquette.</em></p>
				</div>
				
				<br/>
				
				<p>Skill levels are generally rated as per the following table.</p>
							
				<div class="panel-body" id="TBL_SkillLevels">
					<p class="h4">Skill Levels</p>
					<table class="table table-striped table-hover">
					<tbody>
						<tr>
							<td>Zero</td>
							<td>Default for untrained characters</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>One</td>
							<td>Beginner; Most students</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>Two</td>
							<td>Apprentice; Growing in skill</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>Three - Four</td>
							<td>Journeyman; Trained professionals</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>Five - Seven</td>
							<td>Adept; Skilled and respected veterans</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>Eight - Nine</td>
							<td>Master; Well-known and sought after</td>
						</tr>
					</tbody>
					</table>
				</div>
			</div>
			
			<div class="panel-body" id="P_ProficiencyChecks">
				<p class="h4">3. Proficiency Checks</p>
				<p><strong>Proficiency Checks</strong> are Checks made with a dice pool calculated from several 
				contributing scores, and are made by rolling any number of dice drawn from the appropriate pool (Melee,
				Archery, or Sorcery Pool) against Target Numbers that frequently differ from the usual Target Number of 
				seven. They are more fully explained in chapters <a href="../ch4 Melee/Home.html">four 
				(Melee)</a> and <a href="../ch6 Sorcery/Home.html">six (Sorcery)</a>.</p>
			</div>
					
			<div class="panel-body" id="P_OpposedChecks">
				<p class="h4">4. Opposed Checks</p>
				<p><strong>Opposed Checks</strong> are made whenever two Characters or forces match each other for 
				supremacy. Examples include attacking an opponent, detecting an ambush, or slipping past a patrol.</p>
				
				<p>All manner of Checks may be tested against any other, with one Player possibly attempting a Skill Check, 
				while her opponent rolls an Attribute Check in opposition. With Opposed Checks, both participants roll 
				against Target Number seven. The number of successes of the participant with the <em>smaller</em> number of 
				successes are subtracted from the other participant’s, leaving the latter as the winner with a Quality of 
				Success as an indicator of the general degree of victory.</p>
				
				<p>For example, if Otho is trying to lie to a Street Thug, both roll their Falsehood skill against a Target
				Number of seven.  Otho rolls a 12, 8, 7, and 4 for a total of three successes, while the Thug rolls a 10, 3, 
				and a 2 for a total of one success.  The Thug's successes are then subtratced from Otho's (3 - 1) leaving
				Otho with a final result - or Quality of Success - of two.</p>
				
				<p>If an Opposed Skill Check is called for and one party is lacking the required Skill, he may substitute 
				the most appropriate Attribute, as normal, but must compare his result to twice the number of successes of 
				his opponent.</p>
				
				<p>Ties are counted as victories for the party who wants to maintain the status quo. In picking somebody’s 
				pockets, a tie would for example be a failure for the thief, but in attempting to avoid detection by a 
				guard, a tie would be a success.</p>
				
				<p>A Quality of Success of one (1) will always achieve the desired task. If the referee deems this too easy, 
				thinking that additional factors would make the task harder to achieve for one than the other party, he is 
				advised not to call for an Opposed Check, but for a straightforward but difficult Attribute or Skill Check 
				instead.</p>
				
				<p>If an Opposed Check matches one Character against several others at the same time, a single roll is 
				made for every Character, with the solitary character comparing his result with every opponent’s result. 
				For example, if a thief tries to sneak past two soldiers standing guard, one roll is made for the thief and 
				one for every soldier, and the thief’s result compared separately to both results, for two Qualities of 
				Success.</p>
				
				<div class="panel-body bg-warning" id="DIV_Example_MultipleOpponents">
					<p><em><strong>Example</strong>: Otho makes his move at the ball and invites a rich old dowager (and her 
					beautiful diamond necklace!) to dance. As they swirl about the dance floor he directs her to a somewhat 
					unobserved spot and deftly attempts to remove the necklace. An Opposed Check with two antagonists to 
					Otho is now called for: The guard closest to the pair makes a Check of his Sagacity four (4) Attribute, 
					testing his powers of observation. The dowager makes a Check of her Sagacity three (3) Attribute, to 
					determine if she is aware of the necklace being removed.</em></p>
					
					<p>Otho will make a single Check of his Skill of Pick Pockets six (6) against both. Otho needs to tie 
					the guard’s result to pocket the necklace unobserved by the guard (the status quo being that the guard 
					notices nothing special), but he needs to trump the dowager’s successes to filch the necklace (the 
					status quo being that she has it).</p>
					
					<p><em>Unluckily, Otho achieves a single successes, the guard rolls two successes, and the dowager a 
					somewhat lucky two successes as well. While the guard would have noticed nothing out of the ordinary, 
					the dowager feels Otho’s groping fingers and raises a ruckus, leaving Otho to bluff his way out of a 
					tight spot.</em></p>
				</div>
			</div>
			
			<br/>
			
			<div class="panel-body" id="P_TimedChecks">
				<p class="h4">5. Timed Checks</p>
				<p><strong>Timed Checks</strong> can be made of any of the previously mentioned Checks. These rolls are 
				made when the time in which a lengthy task is accomplished is of importance, such as when pursuing research 
				crafting an item, or searching the wilderness for the outlaws’ encampment.</p>
				
				<p>Each Timed Check requires a number of successes that must be achieved over the course of any amount of 
				rolls. Each roll usually represents the passage of a fixed amount of time. With Opposed Timed Checks, the 
				numbers of successes from each component Check are not usually subtracted from each other, but every party 
				totals their successes. As soon as one party achieves the required number of successes, it achieves its goal. 
				This number of successes may or may not be equal. The former would for example be the case in a race, the 
				latter in a pursuit.</p>
				
				<div class="panel-body bg-warning" id="DIV_Example_TimedChecks">			
					<p><em><strong>Example One</strong>: Otho, having been cheated out of some swag from a robbery, is 
					pursuing three fellow thieves through the White Knuckle Mountains. As both parties are traversing the 
					trackless wilderness on foot, the Ref determines that this is an Opposed Check matching Otho’s Survival 
					Skill against the fugitives’ single worst Survival Skill (staying together, they are travelling at the 
					speed of the slowest among them).</em></p>
					
					<p><em>He advises that Otho will need a Quality of Success of twelve (12) against the fugitive’s Quality of 
					Success of eight (8) to catch up with them before they reach, cross, and destroy the sole rope bridge 
					across Raven’s Gorge.</em></p>
					
					<hr/>
					
					<p><em><strong>Example Two</strong>: As the stars are rapidly moving into the constellation presaging 
					the return of the demon lord Yslsl, Braddeyas the sorcerer is attempting to make sense of a coded 
					passage in the Tome of Du’Karrn that is thought to instruct about Yslsl’s weakness. The Referee informs 
					him that he has to achieve a Quality of Success of twenty (20) on his Decipher Skill Check, with every 
					Check taking an entire day, and the stars moving in constellation in seven days.</em></p>
				</div>
			</div>
			
			<br/>
			
			<div class="panel-body" id="P_Complications">
				<p class="h4">Complications</p>
				<p>In <em>Blade</em>, any Unopposed Check that fails to meet its required number of successes by more than 
				one or any Opposed Check made with five (5) or more dice and failing to achieve even a single Quality of 
				Success is what amounts to a botch or bad fumble. However, instead of penalties, catastrophes or comedic 
				moments of embarrassment inappropriate to individuals as formidable as the Players, such results create 
				“Complications”.</p>
				
				<p>While Drama use (see the section on Drama under Passion Attributes in the 
				<a href="../ch3 Training/Home.html">Training chapter</a>) may add specific elements to a story that are of 
				interest to the player, Complications are a way for the referee to add their own plot twists to the tale. 
				They signify something untoward happening to the PC, some newly arising difficulty, or a stroke of luck for 
				his opponents.</p>
				
				<p>Complications should be introduced quickly by the referee, certainly no later than by the following 
				scene, and should have an at least tenuous connection with the task that was badly failed.</p>
				
				<div class="panel-body bg-warning" id="DIV_Example_Complications">			
					<p><em><strong>Example</strong>: Otho, abducting the Radja’s daughter for ransom, battles past a 
					number of guards, and after failing badly twice during the raid, finally manages to slip away with his

					immediately:</em></p>
					
					<ol>
						<li><em>His horse is missing! Hell! The guards are not far behind!</em></li>
						<li><em>Unknown to Otho, he was against all odds recognized by one of the guards. His identity is

			<p class="h4">III. Attribute Descriptions</p>	
			<p>In <em>Blade</em> each character is defined by a set of Attributes that combined, form the core of that 
			individual.</p>
			
			<div class="panel-body" id="DIV_BasicAttributes">
				<p class="h4">1. Basic Attributes</p>
				<p><strong>Basic Attributes</strong>, or just Attributes, are the character’s inherent physical, spiritual, 
				and social capabilities and govern, among other things, how he is perceived by others, how strong, fast, 
				healthy, knowledgeable, and smart he is, and how well developed his instincts and social intelligence are. 
				The six Basic Attributes are:</p>
							
				<div class="panel-body bg-success" id="DIV_BasicAttributeDescription">
					<p class="h4" id="P_Brawn">Brawn (BN)</p>
					<p><strong>Brawn</strong> is a measure of your muscle, your vitality, or your frame. It indicates how 
					much damage you do unaided, and how easily you resist punishment, disease, and poison.</p>
					
					<p class="h4" id="P_Daring">Daring (DG)</p>
					<p><strong>Daring</strong> is a measure of your courage and ability to take decisive action. It affects 
					how well you can strike and parry, as well as how skilled you are with actions like climbing, 
					acrobatics and all kinds of athletics.</p>
					
					<p class="h4" id="P_Tenacity">Tenacity (TY)</p>
					<p><strong>Tenacity</strong> is a measure of your ability to focus on a task or goal, a measure of the 
					strength of your persona. It affects how easily influenced you are, your inner discipline, and your 
					sanity.</p>

				<p class="h4">2. Passion Attributes</p>
				<p>All characters possess four Passion Attributes, or for short, Passions, each having a <strong>maximum 
				value of five (5) points</strong>. In addition, each character has a special fixed Passion Attribute known 
				as “<em>Drama</em>”.</p>
				
				<p>Quite simply, Passion Attributes give your character the will, drive, and determination to accomplish 
				and succeed when the going gets tough.</p>
				
				<p class="h4">How They Work</p>
				<p>If your character is involved in a situation where he is struggling to defend, protect, further, or 
				foster a Passion Attribute, that Passion gives its numerical value as extra dice added to the roll. For 
				Attribute or Skill Checks, when one or more Passion potentially apply, the highest applicable Passion 
				Attribute's value will be added to the appropriate dice pool for the Check.</p>
				
				<p>For example, if you decide that one of your Passions is to find all six artifacts of the first Emperor, 
				and you find an ancient rune clue in a tomb you believe has one of the artifacts, then the Ref might let 
				you add your applicable Passion Attribute's equivalent dice value to your roll to read the rune.</p>
				
				<p>In Combat, Passion Attributes work in a similar manner. However, instead the highest applicable Passion 
				adding its value to every roll, while in combat, <strong>apply the highest applicable Passion Attribute, 
				plus an extra die for every other applicable Passion Attribute, regardless of its current rating, as a 
				scene bonus to the character’s Melee, Archery, and Sorcery Pools</strong>. All Passion Attributes should be 
				collectively determined before play begins, with thought given to the harmony of the varied goals of all 
				players participating in the session. Remember, Passion Attributes let you, <em>the Players</em>, 
				collectively tell the referee exactly what <em>you</em> want the game to be about.</p>
				
				<p class="h4">I Have To Make Them up Myself?</p>
				<p>Yes, you do. This is understandably the most daunting, yet the most exciting task of Character Creation. 
				Regardless of whatever else is written on that sheet, no matter how strong or weak the Characters' 
				other Attributes, combat skills, magical aptitude, or skills, nothing is more influential to that character 
				than those four lines. For a detailed description on how to create your Passions, click 
				<a href="Passions.html">here</a></p>
				
				<p>While your four Passion Attributes define the general story being told, the <em>Drama Passion</em> fine 
				tunes the result. Do you want to develop a love interest with the noblewoman you just met? Spend a Drama 
				point! Do you need a convenient hay wagon to land in when leaping from a window? Spend a Drama point! Drama 
				points can be used in most situations and are earned by roleplaying your character well.</p>
				
				<p class="h4">Passions also advance my Character?</p>
				<p>Yes, they do. You see, anytime you role-play and act on one of your Passion Attributes, the Ref may 
				reward your role-playing with a Passion Attribute point. By acting on a Passion, it shows that it means 
				something to the Character, and it advances. As an aside, the numerical value of any Passion Attribute does 
				not represent its importance to your Character or its priority over your other Passion Attribute’s; that's 
				determined by your role-playing alone, and merely defines which Passion is currently the focus of you, the 
				Player.</p>
				
				<p>So, by playing your Passion Attribute’s, they increase. Now, does the Ref keep a tally of what you did 
				and then dole points out at the end of the session?</p>
				
				<p>No! He <em>immediately</em> awards you with a point and the game becomes a dynamic field, where emotions 
				and drama fluctuate naturally, instead of waiting for the pause between ‘episodes.’</p>
				
				<p class="h4">Wait - So, if They get Awarded at Any Time...</p>
				<p>That’s right! You can <em>spend them</em> at any time. Suddenly do you wish you were a bit stronger, 
				or maybe a bit more nimble of mind? Then spend the points mid game, and it is so. See 
				<a href="../ch2 Characters/Home.html">Chapter Two - Characters</a>, and 
				<a href="../ch3 Training/Home.html">Chapter Three - Training</a> for more information.</p>
