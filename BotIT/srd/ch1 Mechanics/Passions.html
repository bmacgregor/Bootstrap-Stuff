			<p class="h2">Creating Passion Attributes</p>
			<p>The scope of a Passion Attribute can be defined as either broad, narrow, or intermediate.</p>
			
			<p>Assuming a player who has the vague notion that he would like to have a series of adventures about his 
			Character's attempts to become ruler of a nation, a Passion Attribute of <em>Become King by My Own Hand</em> 
			could be considered a Passion Attribute with a broad scope. The same player, envisioning that his Character’s 
			first intermediate step on his rise to the throne will be gaining political influence as protegé of the King’s 
			current Grand Vizier might instead formulate a Passion Attribute of <em>Win the Trust of the Grand Vizier</em>. 
			This could be considered a Passion Attribute of narrow scope. An intermediate position would be if the Player 
			determines that his Character's rise to the throne is not to be by force, but by political means, which he 
			leaves as of yet undefined, formulating a Passion Attribute of <em>Amass Political Influence</em> — an 
			intermediate Passion Attribute.</p>
			
			<p>Each of these three scopes have their own advantages and disadvanatges.</p>

			<p class="h4">Broad Passion Attributes</p>
			<p>The advantage of a broad Passion Attribute like <em>Become King by My Own Hand</em> is that the Passion 
			Attribute can conceivably be considered to be engaged by many different scenarios and situations. Any activity 
			that can be construed as bringing the Character closer to her distant goal, or even just in a position to
			better pursue this goal, can be considered to activate the Passion Attribute. This means that the Player will 
			often have the mechanical benfit of the Passion Attribute. It also makes it easy for the Ref to present the 
			Player with situations and scenes where the Passion will be engaged.</p>
			
			<p>The disadvantage of the broad Passion lies in its fuzziness. If you are playing a Character who still has 
			far to go to assume the mantle of kingship, a broad Passion Attribute like <em>Become King by My Own Hand</em> 
			doesn't really tell the Ref much about what adventures the Player would like to have <strong> right 
			now</strong>. A Character who’s a penniless, unconnected vagabond with such a Passion Attribute can hardly be 
			presented with an opening to become King right away. While a broad Passion  will often be activated, it tells 
			the Ref little about what the Player would like to have adventures about, and the Player will thus find himself 
			frequently at the fringes of scenarios that are tailored more closely to Players who communicated their wishes 
			in a narrow frame and thus, will appear in a supporting role.</p>
			
			<p class="h4">Narrow Passion Attributes</p>
			<p>The advantage of a narrow Passion Attribute like <em>Win the Trust of the Grand Vizier</em> is that it tells 
			the Ref exactly what the player wants to have adventures about. She wants to have adventures where she can
			make herself useful to the Grand Vizier and rise in his esteem. She tells this to the Ref clearly, and 
			the Ref knows what kind of elements to build into the dynamic situation she prepares for the scenario to engage 
			this Player and her narrow Passion Attribute.</p>
			
			<p>The disadavantage of the narrow Passion Attribute is that, while it's clear in defining the Player’s 
			expectations, it will only be engaged by select and specific circumstances. A situation that offers - for 
			example - an opportunity to gain favour with the King himself would not engage the Passion Attribute orientated 
			towards the Grand Vizier. Unless a narrow Passion Attribute is changed frequently — about every second or third 
			session — it will lead to extremely repetitive adventures.</p>
			
			<p>There is a second, potential disadvantage of narrow Passion Attributes, one that enters play in groups with 
			many Players and becomes aggravated if narrow Passion Attributse abound amongst them. It can be difficult, 
			sometimes substantially so, for a Ref to come up with situations that engage <em>many</em> narrow Passions. 
			If everyone has a narrow interest, finding something that piques everbody’s interest isn’t easy.</p>
			
			<p class="h4">Intermediate Passion Attributes</p>
			<p>Intermediate Passion Attributes like <em>Amass Political Influence</em> combine the advantages and 
			disadvanatges from both broad and narrow Passion Attributes to a lesser extent. It tells the Ref more than the 
			broad Passion Attribute, without limiting him in the way the narrow one does. It will be engaged frequently, 
			without the resulting adventures appearing as copies of one another.</p>
			
			<p>While it might appear that an intermediate scope is "best", it shouldn't be thought of that way. Broad and 
			narrow Passions can be just as fun and just as useful, if they are mixed well. A Player Character with only 
			broad Passions will be just as problematic as a Character with only narrow Passions. The secret’s in a good 
			mixture: A broad Passion Attribute or two to cut the Ref some slack in coming up with scenarios and situations 
			engaging your Character and to provide yourself with some broadly applicable bonus dice, and a narrow Passion 
			or two to exactly tell the Ref what you want out of the game <em>right now</em> and to afford him an 
			opportunity to really make your Character into an episode’s main protagonist.</p>

			<p class="h4">Wide and Tight Passion Attribute Spreads</p>
			<p>A second item to consider in creating a Character’s Passion Attributes is their "spread", that is to say, 
			whether they're geared toward the pursuit of several different goals or pointed at closely related ones. For 
			the sake of this discussion, I am going to call the former a "wide" spread, and the latter a "tight" spread.</p>
			
			<p class="h4">The Wide Spread</p>
			<p>A wide spread - one where a Character’s Passions have little to no overlap - has the advantage of being easy 
			on the Ref. As the player communicates a wide range of interests to pursue through scenarios, the Ref should 
			have little difficulty in involving that character in a scenario. The advatage to the Player is that she is 
			virtually assured that one of her Passion Attributes will be engaged in every scene of every scenario. If it 
			isn’t, the referee really isn’t doing her job, considering how easy it was made for hrt by the player in 
			setting up a wide spread of Passion Attributes.</p>
			
			<p>The didsadvantage of such a wide spread is that the Character will rarely encounter situations where more 
			than one of his Passion Attributes are engaged, meaning less bonus dice, both in combat and sorcery, where the 
			highest engaged Passion Attribute adds its rating in dice, plus one die for every other engaged Passion 
			Attribute, as everywhere else, where only the highest engaged Passion Attribute adds its rating — if only one 
			Passion Attributes happens to be activated, there is no choice of applying the “highest” activated one.</p>
			
			<p class="h4">The Tight Spread</p>
			<p>A tight spread, where most or all of a Character’s Passion Attributes do overlap, has the advantage that 
			several of them will usually be engaged at once and thus of providing more bonus dice.</p>
			
			<p>The disadvantage is mainly one for the Referee, and it is similar to the one of narrow Passion Attributes: 
			If a Player expresses interest in only one pursuit, it can be hard for the Referee to consistently come up 
			with scenes that pique this interest and engage the Passion Attributes, especially if the group is large. It is 
			my opinion that, if a Player is as unkind to his Ref as to give him only a tight spread of Passion 
			Attributes to work with in designing scenes, the Ref should be excused if he does occasionally frame scenes 
			that do not engage any of the Passions of that Player. This is doubly true if the group is large, and triply so 
			if that Player’s Passions are also mostly narrow in scope (though it will be rare to have a tight spread of 
			narrow Passion Attributes; a mixture of broad, narrow and intermediate Passion Attributes clustered tightly 
			will be more common).</p>
