			<p><em>You surge forward, away from the camp, and toward the tree-line its dubious freedom.  Your newfound 
			companions run with you, pounding their feet against the packed snow.  Hedeg, the old blind man follows, 
			groping across the frigid expanse.  Within moments, you are plunging through the frosted undergrowth and into 
			the forest.  It's only then that you realize that, despite having escaped together, you don't know which side

			<p><strong>If the Players chose to fight:</strong></p>
			
			<p><em>The last of the Church Knights fall. Long moments pass, as you and your companions suck in huge gouts 
			of air, breathing heavily after the fight. A heavy silence falls among you, and only now do you think to 
			yourself that, despite having fought together, you don't know which side of the many faceted war any of your 
			companions are actually on...</em></p>

				<small>The Beginning of the Adventures</small></p>
				
				<p>So ends the one-shot.  There are a lot of items that have been left purposely vague, should your Players 
				want to continue, here are a few things that got left out that you <em>might</em> (please read that with 
				heavy italics - you should play your game the way your group wants to play, rather than sticking to 
				anything written here) want to include, should you decide to stay in this campaign world:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Traem's Poisoners: </strong>Fornholm's old, dead King was poisoned, but not by his 
					daughter, Alistra, as many believe. Instead, he was killed by Baelin Drannis, head of the Guild of 
					Physikers, who is, in fact an Eldrani agent, and has been working with them for decades.</li><br/>
					
					<li><strong>The Murder of Artorin: </strong>seeing a chance to seize the power vacuum created by his 
					lord's death, Jerlix Fein - head of the Council of Lords - engineered the heir's grisly demise, and 
					cast further suspicion on his sister, Alistra. In so doing, he has named himself Regent, and seeks 
					further power, believing that he will also be also to stem the tide of the war with Eldran.</li><br/>
					
					<li><strong>The Queen's Own: </strong>those staunch in their belief in Alistra's innocence count 
					themselves among the Queen's Own.  Although she has yet to be named Queen, her followers demand that 
					the office be granted to her immediately, and have fought several skirmishes against the Lord's Guard.  
					Their power-base tends to be set among the peasantry, though some nobles feel their lot might be better 
					cast with Alistra, rather than the Lords.</li><br/>
					
					<li><strong>Ranulf's War: </strong>although many see the civil war as the only item of import going on 
					in Fornholm, this is certainly not the case.  Despite being suggested by the Council of Lord's that 
					'Ranulf's War' in Eldran is a waste of resources, in fact, it's a desperate holding action, which, 
					without proper support is doomed to fail, and will herald the Eldrin Empire's full might falling on the 
					unprepared Fornholm.</li><br/>
					
					<li><strong>The Iron Cauldron: </strong>a relic better left to the damned, the Iron Cauldron is a 
					powerful artifact, capable of creating soulless warriors in exchange for the lives of the innocent.  
					Steeped in the darkest necromancies of Lost Naivunnan, the Cauldron is a great evil, compounded by the 
					fact that it is held by Mother Sarevin Caesless and her Gray Church.  As with all things though, using 
					the Cauldron has a cost.</li><br/>
					
					<li><strong>Lost Naivunnan: </strong>a kingdom devoured by magic and evil, the Gray Church have 
					unearthed several of Naivunnan's artifacts, and intend to use them to their advantage in the war for 
					Fornholm.  What they don't realize is that by using these tainted relics, they call Naivunnan back to 
					the world, and awaken the dark that it vanished into a thousand years ago.</li><br/>
