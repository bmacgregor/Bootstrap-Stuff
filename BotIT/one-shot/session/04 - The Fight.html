					<p>The players can get here a variety of different ways - being 
					discovered early (perhaps by breaking stealth, alerting the dogs,
					or running out of time by dithering in the camp).  Because of this
					you may have to treat this section a little differently than 
					presented.  It's written assuming your players have managed to stay
					hidden the entire time, and just discovered the Iron Cauldron at the
					end of Part Three - Getting Weapons, but because sessions can play 
					out with huge differences, much of the text below should be taken
					with a grain of salt.</p>

			<p><em>As you buckle on the last of your newly regained equipment, a shout
			goes up from deeper in the convoy.  You can hear weapons being drawn and
			orders hastily given.  It seems that the time for stealth is drawing to 
			an end.</em></p>

				<p>How the players choose to respond now is entirely up to them; here
				are a few options:
				
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Maintain Stealth: </strong>the players may decide to
					remain hidden in the camp, using their relative stealth to 
					their advantage against the Church Knights' greater numbers.  A 
					combination of sneaking and tracking can be used here to find isolated
					pockets of Knights and dispose of them, although fights lasting 
					longer than a single round-per-combatant are likely to draw the 
					attention of the rest of the Knights.
					
					<br/><br/>
					
					Keep an eye on the number of Knights remaining, recalling that 
					two-thirds of their number are basic Rank-and-File troops, and 
					that of the last third, all but one are Elites, while the last
					- their captain - uses the Champion stat-block. Again, the total 
					number of Church Knights is equal to three times the number of
					players.</li><br/>
					
					<li><strong>Abandon Stealth: </strong>rather than stalking their
					foes throughout the camp, the players may elect to meet force with
					force.  In this case, have them engage a small number of 
					Church Knights at first, and gradually add to the number of enemies
					as the fight progresses.</li><br/>
					
					<li><strong>Escape: </strong>escaping the convoy is detailed in
					the final section of the one-shot, which can be found 
					<a href="05 - The Escape.html">here</a>.</li>
				</ul>
				
				Of course, players being what they are (willful, insolent louts), 
				these options are by no means an exhaustive list.  They might try 
				to draw the Knights off into the woods, setting traps and ambushes
				as they go, or some equally inventive way of harrying the 
				convoy.</p>
				
				<p>It should be noted that if the players venture too far into the 
				forest, the denizens that live there are unlikely to allow them there
				for long.  This is some distance away from the road that they're on 
				(equivalent to a few-hours hike), but let them know that the forest is
				not a safe and friendly place.  What resides there is beyond the scope of
				this adventure, but feel free to invent your own menaces.</p>
				
				<p>Similarly, if the players delay for too long - several days - the
				convoy will be missed, and will be searched for by the Church.  In 
				this case, Witchfinders will come, expecting trouble and ready to 
				bring grief in like kind.  Although the Church Knights and the 
				Witchfinders are both part of a greater whole in the Gray Church,
				they are totally dissimilar, with the Knights being a titular duty 
				(they're not actually knights), held by the Rank-and-File, and the 
				Witchfinders being a nasty bunch of zealots, completely devoid of 
				mercy, but full to the brim with maddening hatred, low cunning, and 
				paranoia.</p>
				
				<p>As with the denizens of the forest, dealing with the Church's 
				Witchfinders is beyond the scope of this one-shot, but as a ref, feel
				free to add them to your game as you see fit.</p>
