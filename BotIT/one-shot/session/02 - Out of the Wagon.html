			<p>From the back of the wagon, Hedeg gropes blindly forward.  </em>'The

			</em>'As for the hounds, they've been trained to obey the Church Knights 
			well enough, but keep them hungry.  The hound-master has their meat in his 
			saddle-bags.  If you can find some valerian leaves, you could mix it into 
			their food.  I'm sure it would do just the trick - valerian grows in the 
			woods, and the hound master's bags are dark red, or so I'm told.  Best be 
			careful, though - the forest is most unkind to the unprepared...'</p>

				<p class="h4">Searching the Camp</p>
					
				<p>Now that everyone's in the relative light of the outdoors, the 
				players can describe what they look like as they venture into a maze 
				of troop supplies and irregularly placed wagons - a convoy far larger 
				than the amount of Church Knights in the area would suggest; this must
				be part of the supply train for the Gray Church, and will most likely 
				meet up with a significantly larger force in time, as any player with 
				even a smattering of <em>Soldiering</em> will be able to tell.</p>
					
				<p>With Hedeg's advice (and caution) the players are now free to 
				explore as they like.  Right now, they're unarmed, but the camp has a 
				variety of things for the escapees to find.  For the most part, the 
				Church Knights are busy trying to move a giant tree that toppled 
				across the road, nearly killing the lead horses and their riders, 
				however, they will soon tire of trying, and given the late hour and 
				the delay, command will issue a halt.  Shortly after that, camp will 
				begin to be set up, which will create a cat-and-mouse game for the 
				players - unknown by the Church Knights - at least at first.</p>

	<div class="container text-justify">
		<p>Ask the players what they're interested in doing - here are a few ideas:
			
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Finding the Valerian</strong> (<em>Survival</em>): While 
			it's true that Valerian does grow in the forest, it looks surprisingly 
			close to Devil's Ire, a powerful stimulant that, when ingested, causes a 
			flurry of activity. If taken in excess, the unfortunate victim goes into 
			furious (and very noisy) spasms, generally followed by death.  Although 
			it'll definitely take care of the dogs in either case, using the second 
			will definitely call the guards down around the players' ears.  To notice 
			the subtle differences between the Valerian and the Devil's Ire requires
			two (2) successes.</li><br/>
			
			<li><strong>Finding the Saddlebag</strong> (<em>Animal Ken</em>): Finding 
			the saddle-bag is just a matter of time for the players - the real feat 
			is stealing the meat from a bag saddled to a trained horse.  This will 
			require two (2) successes to keep the horse quiet.  Minor failure will 
			cause the horse to neigh, which might be noticed, and leave the player 
			without the dog's meals, while if no successes are gained, the horse will 
			rear and call the attention of at least three or four guards.</li><br/>
			
			<li><strong>Locating the Baggage Train</strong> (<em>Soldiering</em>): 
			Based on Hedeg's directions, finding the baggage-train only requires a 
			single (1) success.  There are five dogs (four medium sized and one large)
			that stand a half-hearted watch here, however, if a player comes too close
			(within view), the hounds will immediately attack unless that player can 
			calm them with a difficult <em>Animal Ken</em> check (3 successes).  For 
			the purposes of the timer (see below), making an <em>Animal Ken</em> check 
			also counts as an action.</li><br/>
			
			<li><strong>Stealing Supplies</strong> (<em>Pick Pockets</em>): Small arms
			can be found throughout the camp; anything dagger-sized requires one 
			success pick pocket (1), with larger items requiring one (+1) more 
			successes per range-increment.  For example, because an Arming Sword has a
			reach of Medium (two steps past Hand - the range of a dagger), the 
			<em>Pick Pocket</em> successes needed to find one lying around would be a 
			three (3).  Failure means the item's not available for easy thievery, and a
			complete botch will cause several guards to become alerted.
			
			<br/><br/>
			
			Armour cannot be found in this manner, and will need to be claimed either 
			from dead men, or from the baggage-train.  Similarly, exotic weapons (a 
			katana, for instance) are not typically carried by the Church Knights, and
			are therefore unavailable, however, should an enterprising player attempt 
			to find a disguise, they can dress as a Church Knight by rolling one (1) 
			<em>Pick Pocket</em> successes.</li><br/>
			
			<li><strong>Finding out what Happened</strong> (<em>Sneaking</em>): 
			Sneaking around to the front of the convoy to discover what caused the 
			delay (and allowed the players fortuitous escape) is fairly easy at first,
			and later becomes more difficult.  If the Knights haven't started to set 
			up camp, it can be achieved with a single (1) success.  However, if camp 
			is beginning to be set up, a player will need two (2) successes to make
			their way to the front of the convoy (unless sneaking through the woods,
			which will require two (2) <em>Light Step</em> successes to cover their 
			tracks in the snow), and three (3) successes if the guards have been 
			alerted to their escape.
			
			<br/><br/>
			
			Once at the front, they will find that several enormous trees were 
			uprooted, and lay across the road in heaps.  Clearing the damage will be 
			impossible for the Church Knights, however, going around the wreckage 
			should be possible (but difficult) once the sun is up.  If the player is 
			watching the Church Knights, they will also note when the order is given
			to set up camp, and will not need to roll a <em>Soldiering</em> check (see
			below).</li>
		</ul></p>

				<p class="h4">A Word on Time</p>
				
				<p>Of course, the players may elect to do a variety of other things 
				(and most likely) will - apply the appropriate skill to the action, 
				whatever it might be, and let them try what they will.  Most checks 
				will range from needing one success (easy) to at most three 
				(journeyman) if the action would cause potential for discovery.  
				Naturally, anything that would obviously call the guards down around 
				the player's head's <em>will</em> do so, but for the most part, these 
				actions are assumed to be done with an appropriate level of stealth in
				mind.</p>
				
				<p>There is a timed element to all of the proceedings, however. Once 
				half of the players have done something (found the Valerian, stolen a 
				knife, etc.), the Church Knights will be told to set up camp for the 
				night.  Have all the players attempt <em>Soldiering</em> skill checks,
				requiring one (1) success.  If achieved, the player notices 
				something change in the camp atmosphere, and if two (2) successes 
				are rolled, the player's military background signals to them that the 
				order to halt for the day has been given.  Naturally, this also calls 
				for the prisoners to be fed, which is a problem for the escapees.  
				This occurs <em>whether or not</em> the player was successful in their
				action - an attempt to do anything will count toward this timer 
				ticking down.  It goes without saying that, should a player be 
				watching the Church Knights at the fallen trees, they automatically 
				pass this check.</p>
				
				<p>This realization might prompt one (or several) of the players to 
				try and alert their fellows.  They will now need to sneak through the 
				camp in addition to any other skill check that they are attempting.  
				Sneaking through the camp as the Church Knights begin to set up tents 
				and prepare food requires one (1) <em>Disguise</em> success to 
				maintain stealth.  If the players have stolen a convincing outfit, 
				they can attempt to blend in, so long as they keep their faces 
				covered (the retinue is small enough that any Knight knows his 
				brethren well, and an unfamiliar face will cause alarm).</p>
				
				<p>Once each player has been able to act twice, the escape will be 
				noticed by the camp cook, who will sound the alarm (if the players 
				haven't been noticed already).  In total, there are three-times the 
				number of players in camp as guards, armed with various weapons.  Two 
				thirds of them are basic Rank-and-File grunts, while the last third 
				are either Elites, the camp cook (a townsman), or the retinue's 
				captain, who is uses the Champion stat-block.  They should only be 
				dangerous in large groups, or when the players are unarmed.  
				Naturally, if this number seems too frugal, it can be increased.</p>
