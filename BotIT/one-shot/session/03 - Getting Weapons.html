			<p><em>You find the baggage-train at the rear of the convoy - a large wagon, not unlike the one you and your 
			new companions escaped from, though probably better kept.  A pack of hounds lounge around it, apparently not 
			bothered by the snows.  From your vantage point, it looks like there are ten of the beasts.  Eight of them are 
			unremarkable; average war-dogs that one might expect to be set on peasants, each well muscled and vicious. 
			The last two, however, are massive.  A pair of great, shaggy beasts that tower over the rest, resting together 
			by the wagon's front wheel. Idling nearby is a lazy Church Knight, Cob.</em></p>

			<p class="h4">Cob</p>
				<p>It's up to the Players on how to proceed.  If they have the Valerian (or what they <em>think</em> is the 
				Valerian), now would be the time to mix it with the raw meat stolen from the hound master's saddlebags and 
				throw it - hopefully from somewhere out of view - to the dogs. Dealing with Cob, however, is another matter 
				entirely.</p>
				
				<p>If a Player comes within view, Cob will absolutely shout a warning, unless they are disguised as Church Knights. 
				Cob, himself is new to the group, but is extremely distrustful. The third son of a merchant who wanted to hedge 
				his bets, Cob has been set to the Gray Church for two reasons - first, to get him out of the way (Cob is arrogant 
				and lazy, but full of low cunning) and second, to hopefully win some good will from the Gray Church.</p>
				
				<p>Cob is shirking his duties, avoiding the main effort of helping his brothers clear the road, or get the camp 
				ready for the night's halt. Nevertheless, he's quite alert, and probably won't be snuck up on. If the Players intend
				to ambush and kill Cob, they will need to Check Sneaking, and need to roll three successes to take him unawares. If 
				a Player fails this check, what happens next depends largely on how they appear. If they are dressed as Church Knights, 
				Cob will jump up, and immediately pretend that he was minding the dogs - his hands groping for food he has concealed in 
				his pockets, implying that he's been feeding them. He will greet the interlopers with a cheerful tone, but Players can 
				roll Falsehood to see through this act, noting that he's clearly trying to hide his true intentions (in this case, 
				simple laziness).</p>
				
				<p>If the Player's aren't disguised when (and if) they're noticed, Cob won't immediately raise an alarm. Instead, 
				he'll blurt out "Who the hell are you?!" in a sharp whisper. If the Players charge in to attack, Cob will raise his 
				hands in a sign of peace or surrender, and beg the Characters to wait. The dogs, however, will definitely begin 
				putting up a fuss, and in the event of combat, will absolutely attack.</p>
				
				<p>Cob hates the Church Knights, and wants to desert - all he needs is a chance to do so. He's stolen a key to the 
				baggage train, and intends to filch supplies from it before escaping into the forest and heading towards Whitelake, 
				a nearby village. He doesn't know anything about the Cauldron (other than it gives him the shivers), and if the 
				Characters agree to cause chaos to let him slip off, he's more than willing to open the wagon with his key for them.</p>
				
				<p>This little scene will, naturally, require some Role Play on the part of the Players, but can be skipped entirely if 
				Cob is somehow led away from the baggage. Perhaps an enterprising Player wants to attempt an Acting check, or some other 
				plan. If they come up with something, absolutely let them try. It shouldn't require more than two sucesses, unless their 
				idea is totally unfeasable. If they manage to lure Cob off, all they have to deal with are the dogs, which is described 
				below.</p>

			<div class="panel-body bg-warning">
			<p class="h4">The Dogs</p>
				<p>If Cob is gotten rid of quietly, and so long as they're holding food, the dogs won't immediately attack - low 
				growls will be heard, and the large hounds will turn to look at the Player.  Feeding the dogs this way 
				is <em>extremely</em> ill-advised.  Have the Player roll an <em>Animal Ken</em> check, needing two (2) 
				successes.  If they succeed, the animals remain wary, but hesitate.  If the Player only rolls one (trained) 
				success, the hounds begin barking.  The fuss will call the hound-master over, who will arrive at some 
				inconvenient time for the Players.  If he spots them before the Players have dealt with the dogs, he will 
				shout an alarm and order the beasts to attack.  Finally, if an untrained Player attempts and fails, or a 
				trained Character fails by more than one, the dogs raise all kinds of hell, baying and snarling, and rise 
				up to attack the offending Player, all thoughts of food cast aside.</p>
				
				<p>Similarly, if the Players do <em>not</em> come with food (looking for the baggage train with the intent 
				to fight their way to their gear), the hounds will respond accordingly.  Again, the hound-master will 
				arrive in due course and call guards down on the Players.  In all likelihood - under geared and 
				overwhelmed - the Players will probably die.  Do your best to avoid having this happen by playing up the 
				danger of the situation - a successful one-shot should be fun, and invite your Players <em>back</em> to the 
				table to try out an actual campaign.  That said, if you're playing with people who have gotten themselves 
				into this situation, maybe killing them is the right answer.</p>
				
				<p>Finally, if the Players are able to get the food to the hounds (either by feeding them directly, or by 
				throwing the meat to them), the encounter plays out depending on the success of their survivalist. If the 
				Players successfully found the Valerian, the hounds fall into a deep sleep relatively quickly.  The large 
				hounds succumbs as well, eventually, but takes longer than the rest of their pack.  Should the Player's 
				feed the hounds the Devil's Ire, however, the result is slightly different.  Instead of falling into 
				peaceful slumber, they go completely mad, baying loudly and causing hell.  As the poison begins to work 
				through their systems, they will run through the camp, knocking over anything in their path, and unable to 
				distinguish friend from foe.</p>
				
				<p>Should this happen, all pretense of stealth will be utterly destroyed, however, it might be of benefit 
				to the Players, since the ensuing chaos will provide a perfect distraction for them to retrieve their gear 
				from the baggage-train, though maybe not provide them with enough time to equip everything.</p>

		<p class="h4">Approaching the Wagon</p>
		
		<p><em>You approach the wagon, ready to take back what the Church Knights had stolen from you.  Rounding the back, 
		you nearly run into a cauldron large enough for a person to stand in.  Embossed figures dance and writhe along its 
		dull iron casing, and ancient letters crawl like serpents around the mouth of the great crucible.</p>
		
		<p>A moment later, Hedeg shuffles into view, his hair swirling in the winter winds.</em>  'Gods,' <em>he whispers, 
		holding a hand out to steady himself on the back of the wagon, </em>'it's worse than I thought.'<em>  The old man 
		is facing the cauldron, and his voice, though low, is filled with loathing; his sightless eyes narrowed in utter 
		revulsion.</em></p>
		
		<p>'Quickly then,' <em> he says after a moment, </em>'mustn't stay too close to this blasted thing,' <em> and he 
		moves off, letting the rest of you past.</em></p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="container text-justify">
		<p class="h4">Getting the Goods</p>
		<p>The wagon is, of course, locked. Characters can attempt to unlock it using Hedeg's makeshift tools, but need two 
		successes to open it, or, if they chose to work with Cob and he gave them stolen key, can open it automatically. 
		Provided they still have time before they are found, Players can begin equipping their Characters - pulling on a single 
		piece of armour costs on action, with a pair of gauntlets or greaves counting as one piece. Shields, most weapons, and 
		helmets are considered free <em>so long as Players mention this action</em>. Otherwise, it's assumed that, while weapons 
		are grabbed, Characters may have had other things on their minds instead of donning helms or strapping on shields.</p>
		
		<p>If an alarm hasn't been raised, Players have three actions each before they are discovered, otherwise, they have a 
		single action each. Alternatively, a limelight round can be used to don two pieces of equipment provided the Character is 
		not engaged in combat.</p>

		<div class="panel panel-default">
			<div class="panel-body bg-warning">
				<p class="h4">The Iron Cauldron</p>
				
				<p>Players will now, no doubt, be curious about the Iron Cauldron, and its ancient letters.  A particularly 
				enterprising Character might be tempted to read the script that appears on the relic, despite Hedeg's clear 
				abhorrence for the artifact.  If an attempt is made, have the Player roll for <em>Decipher</em>. Anything 
				less than three (3) successes reveals nothing other than the script is clearly archaic, but nothing 
				more.</p>
				
				<p>Rolling four or greater, however, higher than this tells the Player that the language could be Naivunnan, a 
				corrupted civilization, long lost to this world. Naivunnan texts are largely unknown, and other than a 
				scrap ofhistory, they can't tell much more beyond this. In either case, studying the script is difficult, 
				as it wavers sickeningly within the viewer's sight, and Hedeg will most likely scold the curious Player, 
				saying that wiser minds know when to leave well enough alone.</p>
				
				<p>Touching the chill metal will leech heat from a Character - indeed, it seems that the winter is far 
				harsher near the cauldron, its bitter vileness bleeding into the marrow of any who try to stand close for too 
				long.  Climbing inside would be akin to dropping oneself into a bath of nitrogen, that is to say, a very poor 
				choice, and probably fatal.</p>
