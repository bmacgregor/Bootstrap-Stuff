				<p class="h3">Character Arc</p>
				<p>A Character's Arc is central to who they are. It defines them as a person, informs their role-play 
				decisions, and gives a good indication of how they might react to certain situations.</p>
				
				<p>In a sense, it's linked to their background - how and where they grew up, the things they struggle with, 
				what they want - but it also acts as a signal to the Game Master for the sorts of adventures that you, the 
				Player, are interested in, as well as the expected outcome of those adventures.</p>
				
				<!-- Put an example of choosing an Arc here -->
				
				<!-- Write a list of example Arcs to choose from -->
				
				<!-- State that following your Arc gives everyone in the group experience or drama points or whatever -->
			</div>

		<div class="panel panel-default">
			<div class="panel-body" id="DIV_Attributes">
				<p class="h3">Attributes</p>
				<p>While a Character's Arc determines how they are role-played, attributes define what they're capable of, 
				in-game. Every Character begins play with thirty points to spend on attributes, with the sole caution that 
				only one attribute can be as low as 1, and only one can be as high as 8. Beyond this, Players can spend 
				their points any way they like. Bonuses to each attribute are listed below.</p>
				
				<br/>
				
				<div class="row"> <!-- Make the italic stuff into tables - shorter, easier to understand -->
					<div class="col-md-6">
						<p class="h4">Intellect</p>
						<p>Intellect affects the power behind a Character's spells, with more intelligent Characters able to 
						create powerful effects. Genius-level Mages are able to strip the flesh from their opponent's bones 
						and warp reality with their minds.</p>
						
						<p><em>For each point of Intellect above four, Characters add a +1 die bonus to their spell 
						effects - both for damage as well as all other sorcerous abilities, making the casting much more 
						impressive. For each point below four, they suffer a -1 modifier to all spell effects.</em></p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="col-md-6">
						<p class="h4">Brawn</p>
						<p>Brawn modifies the amount of raw, physical damage a <em>Duelist</em> is capable of dishing out, 
						with the mightiest of heroes able to cripple an opponent with a single strike; in combat, a 
						<em>Duelist</em> with a focus on Brawn is a force to be reckoned with.</p>
						
						<p><em>For each point of Brawn above four, Characters add a +1 die bonus to their physical damage 
						scores, and add an extra die to bashes against inanimate objects for every other point. For 
						Characters with Brwns scores of less than four, they suffer a -1 modifier to both physical damage 
						rolls and attempts to bash inanimate objects.</em></p>
					</div>
				</div>
				
				<hr/>
				
				<div class="row">
					<div class="col-md-6">
						<p class="h4">Cunning</p>
						<p>Cunning <em>Duelists</em> may lack power, but they make up for it in scope and speed, weaving 
						spells that affect larger areas and able to deflect sorceries cast at them. Those with 
						exceptionally high Cunning also benefit from faster casting times.</p>
						
						<p><em>For each point of Cunning above four, Characters can expand their spells' radius by one step 
						(as noted in the spell description). For every two points above four, they can cast spells one step 
						faster (as indicated in the description) and add gain a bonus die for spell deflection rolls. For 
						Characters with scores below four, their spell radii are reduced by one step, and they suffer a -1 
						penalty to all spell deflection rolls.</em></p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="col-md-6">
						<p class="h4">Agility</p>
						<p><em>Duelists</em> that focus on Agility are able to engage multiple opponents at once, and often 
						use their speed in quick-draw style duels. They are better suited to dodging attacks and making 
						follow-up ripostes, striking as soon as an opening appears.</p>
						
						<p><em>For each point of Agility above four, Characters can engage one extra melee combatant at no 
						penalty. For every two levels above four, they also gain a bonus die for all dodge rolls, and +1 
						speed bonus. For every point below four, a Character has great difficulty engaging multiple foes, 
						and pays one extra point of stamina to defend against them. They also suffer a -1 penalty to speed 
						and a -1 penalty to all dodge rolls for every two points of Cunning below four.</em></p>
					</div>
				</div>
				
				<hr/>
				
				<div class="row">
					<div class="col-md-6">
						<p class="h4">Will</p>
						<p>Characters with a high will stat are able to hold and maintain spells, and build an 
						impenitrable wall of defence. Will also governs how many spells can be cast before the 
						<em>Duelist</em> needs to rest, and is a marker of a Character's sanity.</p>
						
						<p><em>For each point of Will above four, the Character rolls an extra die for the purposes of 
						sorcerous exhaustion. For every two points above four, a Character can maintain a spell one step 
						longer, as outlined in the spell's description, and gains a an extra die to their mental shield. 
						For every point below four, the Character takes a -1 penalty towards Checks for exhaustion. For 
						every two points below four the Character suffers a -1 penalty to their mental shield rolls and 
						their spell duration is shortened by one step.</em></p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="col-md-6">
						<p class="h4">Endurance</p>
						<p><em>Duelists</em> with high Endurance are capable of staying in fights the longest, as Endurance 
						is directly linked to a Character's stamina. These workhorses have bonuses to their health, and can 
						wear the heaviest armours and wield the largest weapons with ease.</p>
						
						<p><em>For each point of Endurance above four, the Character rolls an extra die for the purposes of 
						fatigue. For every two points above four, a Character can wear heavier armour and wield larger 
						weapons at less of a penalty, as outlined in the equipment's description, and gains a bonus die to 
						their physical defence. For every point below four, the Character takes a -1 penalty to fatigue 
						Checks, and for every two points below four, are penalized for their equipment load, as outlined in 
						the equipment's decription. They also take a -1 penalty to defence rolls.</em></p>
					</div>
				</div>
				
				<br/>
				
				<p class="h3">A Word on Magic</p>
				<p>Not every Player will want a magic capable Character, but half of the attributes in <em>Duelist</em> 
				work with the magic system, and because of this there may be an inclination to dump those stats. First off, 
				don't. Although magic is described later, there are overt cases - things like tossing fireballs, or walking 
				through walls - however, there are a lot of covert and utility spells as well; subtle buffs, heightened 
				senses, healing, and effects that have a much less flash to them.</p>
				
				<p>In this way, Players can choose between creating a dedicated battle-mage, complete with world-shattering 
				spells that lay waste to everything around them (a traditional 'blasty' wizard), or a talented warrior with 
				preternatural abilities that, perhaps, they can't explain because they lack the flash of what most people 
				think of as 'magical'.</p>
