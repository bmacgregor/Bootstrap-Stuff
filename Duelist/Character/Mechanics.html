				<p class="h3">Dice Used</p>
				<p><em>Duelist</em> uses ten-sided dice (or d10's) for nearly everything in the game. Players will need to 
				have at least ten d10's available to them, and in some situations (like combat, for instance) they might 
				need even more. Players will also need two six-sided dice (d6's). Ideally, one d6 should be red and the 
				other, black, but the colours don't really matter. What <em>is</em> important is that a Player has two 
				d6's, and that they are <strong>different colours</strong>. This is gone into more detail in the 
				<a href="../Combat/Home.html">Combat</a> chapter, but to briefly explain:</p>
				
					<div class="panel-body bg-info" id="INFO_d6Colour">
						<p>When combat starts, Players have to decide if they want to attack or defend. Unless its obvious 
						(like in an ambush, or on a charge), opponents will have to gauge one another, trying to figure out 
						when an opportune time to attack might be. To represent this, opponents will conceal one of the 
						d6's in their hand, hiding the other one away.</p>
						
						</p>A red d6 indicates an attack, while a black d6 means the Character is defending. The dice are 
						revealed at the same time, and might result in the opponents attacking each other at the same time, 
						only one attacking, or the combatants circling and waiting for an opening. This is more fully 
						explained in the Combat chapter, however, and is included here as a note for the curious.</p>

		<div class="panel panel-default">
			<div class="panel-body" id="DIV_Attributes">
				<p class="h3">Attributes</p>
				<p>Attributes in <em>Duelist</em> are split into two broad categories, Mind and Body, with each describing 
				a measure of a Character's strength, dexterity, and toughness.</p>
				
				<br/>
				
				<div class="row">
					<div class="col-md-6">
						<p class="h4">Intellect</p>
						<p>Intellect is a measure of a Character's strength of mind. It determines how quickly a Character 
						can learn things, their general knowledge, and the amount of power they can throw into their 
						spells. A Character with high intellect can put massive force behind their sorceries.</p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="col-md-6">
						<p class="h4">Brawn</p>
						<p>Brawn describes a Character's raw, physical power. With high strength, a Character can deliver 
						crippling strikes and batter down doors, as well as how much a Character can lift at a given time, 
						and a general idea of how much brute force they can bring to bear.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				
				<hr/>
				
				<div class="row">
					<div class="col-md-6">
						<p class="h4">Cunning</p>
						<p>Cunning represents a Character's ability to out-think opponents. It is as much used by generals 
						as it is by thieves, and is used for outmaneuvering in battles, trap-making and trap-finding, and 
						creating devious puzzles. Combined with sorceries, Cunning can be used to find gaps in an opponents 
						defence.</p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="col-md-6">
						<p class="h4">Agility</p>
						<p>Agility determines how easily a Character can avoid punishment; it governs dodging in combat, 
						how easily a Character is able to evade killing blows, and their speed. A truly agile Character can 
						move an incredible speed, and often uses blitz-like tactics to deal with opponents.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				
				<hr/>
				
				<div class="row">
					<div class="col-md-6">
						<p class="h4">Will</p>
						<p>Will is how strong a Character's mind is. For sorceries, it governs how long a <em>Duelist</em> 
						can hold a spell, and to what extent they are able to increase the effects of their sorceries. A 
						Character that can envelop a city in a protective shield or bring time to a crawl possesses an 
						incredibly strong Will.</p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="col-md-6">
						<p class="h4">Endurance</p>
						<p>Endurance determines a Character's physical mettle - it governs how long they're able to stay in 
						Combat, how much gear they can use, and the amount of punishment they're able to take. A 
						<em>Duelist</em> encased in heavy armour, carrying a tower shield, and wielding a warhammer has a 
						high Endurance.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				
				<p>Attributes are rated from one to eight, with a score of one signifying a crippling impairment in a given 
				area, while an eight denotes complete mastery of the associated score.</p>

			<div class="panel-body" id="DIV_Checks">
				<p class="h3" id="P_CHECK_Intro">The Need for Checks</p>
				<p>Generally, Checks don't need to be rolled. <em>Duelists</em> are competent adventurers, and games 
				shouldn't be bogged down by rolling for every little thing - menial tasks like finding wood for a campfire 
				can be hand-waved rather than checking if a Character has the necessary survival skills and then rolling 
				dice to see if they're able to find wood.</p>
				
				<p>Things that are more difficult, such as forging weapons or pushing a horse to gallop across broken 
				country can generally skirt the need for rolling a Check as well, <em>provided that they are 
				role-played</em>. This adds flavour to a game and the experience of everyone at the table; for example, if 
				a Player needed to scale some cliffs under the cover of nightfall, they might role-play it out, describing 
				the lashing winds and salt-filled gusts from the turbulent sea below as they grope blindly for handholds, 
				hauling themselves toward the clifftop.</p>

				<p>Although there is an element of danger here, it's assumed that the Game Master has included this scene 
				for its cinematic nature and to deepen the story for the Players. As such, it's <em>assumed</em> that the 
				Players will survive the climb so that they can carry on with the adventure. Allowing Players to role-play 
				difficult sections out, rather than rolling for them moves the story along and also immerses the table in 
				the world.</p>
				
				<hr id="P_CHECK_WhenToRoll">
				
				<p class="h3">When Should Checks be Rolled?</p>
				<p>If a Check has a <em>significant</em> element of failure, such as the death of several NPC's, derailment 
				of a Character's plans, Character death, or any possible branch in the Game Masters story that is directly 
				affected by the Character's success or failure, a Check is rolled. Checks should serve as junctures in the 
				plot - a time when something can go as planned or spiral out of control.</p>
				
				<div class="panel-body bg-success" id="RULE_RollingChecks">
					<p class="h4">How to Roll for a Check</p>
					<p>First, the Game Master chooses a Difficulty Level (see below). This is based on how hard or easy the 
					proposed action is - something like vaulting over a table in a melee is considered to be fairly simple, 
					while tracking someone through a swamp under heavy rains a week late is next to impossible*. It's 
					considered good form to tell the Player what the difficulty level is before they roll the dice.</p>
					
					<p>The Difficulty Level is how many successes a Player needs to roll to succeed at the Check. A success 
					is any roll of six (6) or higher on a d10. Anything lower than this (five or less) counts as a failure. 
					The number of successes a Player rolls is called the <strong>Margin of Success</strong>, and indicates 
					how well a Character does at any given Check.</p>
					
					<p>Next, the Player rolls dice based on the skill being tested. If a Character doesn't have the 
					relevant skill, they can still make an attempt, but require <strong>twice as many</strong> successes as 
					required by the Check. For instance, if a Character needs three successes to calm an enraged bear, they 
					could either use an appropriate skill to try and get the three successes needed, or they could use an 
					attribute. If the Player opts to use an attribute, they would need to roll <em>six</em> (3 * 2 = 6) 
					successes to calm the bear.</p>
					
					<p><em>* A Note to Game Masters: unless you have a good reason, don't make things impossible. That 
					said, Players shouldn't be able to Mary Sue their way through everything, citing this small note as 
					reason for why "befriending the dragon / seducing the main villain / creating their own demi-plane" 
					ought to be possible. Use common sense.</em></p>
				</div>
					
				<br id="P_CHECK_OpposedChecks">
					
				<p class="h3">Opposed Checks</p>
				<p>NPC's can oppose a Character's Check. This can happen in a variety of situations; some examples include 
				when a Character tries to lie to someone, attempts to outrun (or catch) an NPC, and in most combat 
				situations. In these cases, where one party is opposing another, a Check is rolled, as normal, but there 
				isn't a Difficulty Level assigned. Instead, the Character's successes are compared against the NPC's, and 
				whomever has the most is the successful party. In the event that a Margin of Success is needed (for 
				calculating damage, for instance) the higher amount of successes is subtracted from the lower total.</p>
				
				<div class="panel-body bg-warning" id="EXAMPLE_OpposedChecks">
					<p><strong>Example</strong>: Rell is trying to barter with a shopkeep to get a better price for the 
					wolf pelt she's selling. Because the shopkeep is unwilling to give her a better deal (and loves to 
					barter), the Game Master calls for an Opposed Negotiation Check. Rell's Negotiation is a four (having 
					dealt with frugal merchants for years), and the shopkeep has a three. Both roll their respective pool 
					of dice.</p>
					
					<p>Rell rolls a 9, 4, 7 and a 1. The 9 and the 7 are counted as successes (both 6 or greater) for a 
					total of two successes. The shopkeep rolls a 10, 5, and a 3 for a single success.</p>
					
					<p>Rell's total (2) is subtracted from the shopkeep's total (1), leaving her with a Margin of 
					Success of 1. Somewhat grudgingly, the shopkeep gives her a slightly better price for the pelt, his 
					eyes twinkling from the exchange.</p>
				</div>
					
				<p>In the above example, Rell's Margin of Success directly impacted the price difference for her sale. Had 
				she rolled more successes, the Game Master would have been obligated to give her an even better price. 
				Conversely, had the shopkeep beaten her in the Check, he could have offered her an even <em>lower</em> 
				price.</p>
				
				<p>Once a Check is made, it stands. Further Checks can be made, but are impacted by the previous attempts. 
				For instance, if Rell wanted to drive an even harder bargain, she could try to Negotiate again, however, 
				her successes would only be <em>half</em> as effective. This means that she would need two successes for 
				every one of the shopkeep. Characters can certainly push their luck with this (re-checking for traps, 
				further trying to intimidate a foe, etc.) but things become much harder if follow-up Checks are attempted. 
				In Rell's case, although she's secured a better price for her pelt, she could risk offending the shopkeep, 
				being thrown out of the store, or outright banned from coming back.</p>
				
				<hr id="P_CHECK_TimedChecks">
				
				<p class="h3">Timed Checks</p>
				<p>Timed Checks are handled a little differently than an Opposed Check. To succeed at a timed task, the 
				Game Master will assign a Difficulty <em>Total</em> and a number of attempts the Character has to reach the 
				total. For instance, Characters desperately searching a library for a scroll to give them information 
				needed to stop a demon lord from being summoned might need to accumulate twenty-five Search successes across 
				three rounds of Searching (a round being long enough for each Player to roll once). If they are successful, 
				the scroll is found in time. If they are too slow, however, a hellish portal will tear the fabric of 
				reality, allowing the Demon Lord and its subjects to pour through into their world...</p>
				
				<hr id="P_CHECK_TiedChecks">
				
				<p class="h3">Tied Checks</p>
				<p>A tied Check results in a success for the party that wants to maintain the status quo. In combat, this 
				means an attacker misses (the status quo being that the defender is uninjured). If a Character is 
				attempting to steal something from an NPC, it indicates that the NPC keeps the object (though, doesn't 
				notice the Character's attempt, this also being part of the status quo). In Rell's example, it would mean 
				that the shopkeep is firm on the price offered.</p>
				
				<hr id="P_CHECK_FailedChecks">
				
				<p class="h3">Failed Checks</p>
				<p>While a successful Check has a positive Margin of Success, a failed Check has a Margin of Failure. 
				Generally speaking, a small Margin of Failure simply means that the Check fails. A Character is unable to 
				climb a wall in time, and might be caught by the guards; an attempt at thievery is unsuccessful, and might 
				be noticed - in short, something goes awry.</p>
				
				<p>If a Check is failed by two or more, a minor complication ensues, as determined by the Game Master. 
				This won't be anything catastrophic, but will definitely put a Character in a difficult spot. A Character 
				Navigating their way through the trackless wilderness might blunder around, arriving late to their 
				destination, or unable to find a suitable spot to camp for the night and have to make due sleeping in an 
				exposed place. Someone attempting to translate a piece of lore might believe the text says something 
				entirely different, and while this might not cause massive detriment to their studies, it will certainly 
				cause an issue which will leave the Player on the back-foot.</p>
				
				<p>In short, a Margin of Failure by two or more is a setback, something that wastes time and resources, 
				but that can (with effort) be corrected. In the case of a thief attempting to filch a purse, their attempt 
				will be noticed, but they might be able to correct their blunder without a significant amount of 
				trouble.</p>
				
				<p>A Margin of Failure of five or more, however, implies dire consequences. In a chase, a Character might 
				run headlong into a door that opened at the exact wrong time, sending them sprawling. They will likely have 
				to contend with whomever opened the door in the first place (as they likely pelted right into the unlucky 
				person, and based on the nature of the failure, this is probably a guard, or several guards) <em>and 
				also</em> deal with their pursuers who - if they haven't caught up yet - have certainly gained on them due 
				to the mishap. Depending on the pursuers, this likely means a fight which the Character might be woefully 
				unprepared for.</p>

					<p><strong>Example</strong>: For his game, Mike wants to incorporate a timed Check. He has four Players 
					in his party, and wants the Check to be done quickly - two rounds. Multiplying the Players by the time 
					he gets a total of eight (4 players x 2 rounds = 8). Mike wants this Check to be Demanding for his 
					Players; referencing the Timed Check total, he finds that Demanding Checks are multiplied by 2. He
