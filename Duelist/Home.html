			<p class="h2"><strong>Welcome to <em>Duelist</em></strong></p>
			<p class="text-justify"><em>Duelist</em> is a medieval pen and paper RPG that focuses on combat as a dynamic
			field, where Player choice is an intrinsic part of the games' flow. Rather than simply attacking and defending, 
			in <em>Duelist</em>, Characters use Combat Abilities, which, combined with their choice of weapon, dramatically 
			changes how they approach any given situation.</p>
			
			<p>Players explore a deadly setting and create bold, interesting Characters who pursue their own goals and are 
			driven by their own motivations. Unlike many pen and paper RPG's, this means that the Game Master creates a 
			world, filling it with weight and circumstance, but the Players provide focus for the adventures within that 
			world.</p>

			<p class="h4">Your Character</p>
			<p><em>Duelists</em> are powerful, driven protagonists in a world that is often harsh; their stories tend to be 
			darker than those of more traditional Role-Playing Games, and because of this, <em>Duelist</em> Characters are 
			flawed. Sessions will ask difficult things of the Players. Rarely will a choice be simply black or white; 
			instead, Characters will be asked to consider the implications of their actions. This makes for rich gameplay, 
			and allows for growth - an actual Character arc - by creating difficult, interesting story moments that 
			challenge both the Player and the Character.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4">Character Arcs</p>
			<p>The most important idea, central to any <em>Duelist</em> is their arc - the story that your Character is 
			meant to tell. Are you interested in Role-playing someone who's tale is about redemption? Or perhaps a fall from 
			grace? Is your Character driven by vengeance? Or are they a wandered, seeking to escape their past? All of these 
			are examples of the <strong>Character Arc</strong> - an idea central to who your Character is. The Arc informs 
			all (or almost all) of a Character's actions in game, and signals the Game Master what you want their story to 
			be about.</p>
			
			<p>Arcs are described more fully later in the rules, but they are presented first due to their prominence. If 
			nothing else - beyond visceral combat situations, adventures, or the world itself - it's the Arc of a Character 
			that truly matters in <em>Duelist</em>.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4">Your Weapon</p>
			<p>The weapon a Character chooses has a powerful effect on how they operate in combat. Each weapon provides 
			different options to the Player - they may grant bonuses to a particular style of combat, deliver slow but 
			crushing blows, or open up entirely new methods of attack. In short, a Characters Arc defines their story - how 
			they act in the world and the situations they'll be faced with - but their weapon further calcifies their 
			choices. Both choices solidify <em>who</em> the Character <em>is</em>. The Arc supports how a Character 
			Role-plays, and the weapon details how they respond in combat.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4">Abilities</p>
			<p><em>Duelist</em> is a game of choices, and abilities are a way of defining what your Character can do. While 
			deciding what weapon (or weapons) you want your Character to use is critical, picking their Abilities gives them 
			even more detail. Abilities focus a Character, allowing them to act as an agile warrior, an immovable wall of 
			steel, an archer who can fill the air with death, or a mage capable to shattering the minds of their foes. 
			Rather than confining Characters to classes, Abilities allow Players to mix and match different ideas, creating 
			a vast array of Character types.</p>

			<p>A Character might be a sneak thief, capable of teleporting behind foes and delivering lightning-fast attacks 
			before blinking away, or they might play a Sorcerer that grows hideous claws and can split herself into multiple 
			copies to engage three foes at once. A knight who sends enemies sprawling to the ground by bashing them with his 
			shield before demolishing them with a warhammer, or calling the lightning down on them. There are many 
			possibilities for Players to choose from to make truly original Characters.</p>
